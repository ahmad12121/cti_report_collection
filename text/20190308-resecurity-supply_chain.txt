Organization: Internet Archive

The Internet Archive discovers and captures web pages through many
different web crawls. At any given time several distinct crawls are
running, some for months, and some every day or longer. View the web
archive through the Wayback Machine.

Collection: Live Web Proxy Crawls

Content crawled via the Wayback Machine Live Proxy mostly by the Save
Page Now feature on web.archive.org.   
  
 Liveweb proxy is a component of Internet Archive’s wayback machine
project. The liveweb proxy captures the content of a web page in real
time, archives it into a ARC or WARC file and returns the ARC/WARC
record back to the wayback machine to process. The recorded ARC/WARC
file becomes part of the wayback machine in due course of time.

Supply Chain – The Major Target of Cyberespionage Groups

Mar 08, 2019

Cyberespionage

The Iranian-linked group known as IRIDIUM has hit more than 200
government agencies, oil and gas companies and technology companies
including Citrix Systems, Inc.

Resecurity has shared the acquired intelligence with law enforcement and
partners for mitigation.

Friday, December 28, 2018 at 10:25 AM – Resecurity reached out to Citrix
and shared an early warning notification about a targeted attack and
data breach. Based on the timing and further dynamics, the attack was
planned and organized specifically during Christmas period.

The incident has been identified as a part of a sophisticated
cyberespionage campaign supported by nation-state due to strong
targeting against government, military-industrial complex, energy
companies, financial institutions and large enterprises involved in
critical areas of economy.

Based our recent analysis, the threat actors leveraged a combination of
tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs) allowing them to conduct a
targeted network intrusion to access at least 6 terabytes of sensitive
data stored in the Citrix enterprise network, including e-mail
correspondence, files in network shares and other services used for
project management and procurement.

The arsenal of IRIDIUM includes proprietary techniques allowing to
bypass 2FA authorization for critical applications and services for
further unauthorized access to VPN (Virtual Private Networks) channels
and SSO (Single Sign-On).

We forecast a continued growth of targeted cyber-attacks on supply
chains of government and large enterprises organized by state-actors and
sophisticated cyberespionage groups.

Below are the indicators of IRIDIUM activity available for disclosure
(for today). We will update the list with new information once it
becomes available.

We would like to thank the following organizations for their timely
assistance and collaboration regarding the malicious network activity
during the Winter 2018 period: DHL, NBC (National Bank of Canada),
Skrill, PayPal and Canadian Centre for Cyber Security.

Updated (5:09 PM Monday, March 11, 2019 PDT)

The Global Access List (GAL) acquired as the result of password-spraying
(on Citrix employee accounts), which is a type of attack for
brute-forcing and credential-stuffing, includes 31,738 records. The
threat actors leveraged it for further reconnaissance and accounts
compromise. Based on our analysis, one of these elevated actions was
conducted on Monday, October 15, 2018 at 1:57 AM.

[]

Password-spraying was one of the most commonly used techniques by Mabna
Institute hackers and their associates during the early stage of the
attacks to gain a foothold in the victim’s environment. More information
about their techniques is available in FBI Flash Alert (ME-000092-TT):

-   Leveraging the initial group of compromised accounts, download the
    Global Address List (GAL) from a target’s email client, and perform
    a larger password spray against legitimate accounts.
-   Using the compromised access, malicious actors attempt to expand
    laterally (e.g., via Remote Desktop Protocol or other means) within
    the network, and perform mass data exfiltration.

  
 Updated (8:55 PM Monday, March 11, 2019 PDT)

As a result, threat actors conducted network intrusion to access data in
Citrix infrastructure remotely.
