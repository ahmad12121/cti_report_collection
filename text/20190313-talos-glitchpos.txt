GlitchPOS: New PoS malware for sale

[]

  
   
 Warren Mercer and Paul Rascagneres authored this post with
contributions from Ben Baker.  
   

Executive summary {#h.o88vlpb5bz5u}
-----------------

  
 Point-of-sale malware is popular among attackers, as it usually leads
to them obtaining credit card numbers and immediately use that
information for financial gain. This type of malware is generally
deployed on retailers' websites and retail point-of-sale locations with
the goal of tracking customers' payment information. If they
successfully obtain credit card details, they can use either the
proceeds from the sale of that information or use the credit card data
directly to obtain additional exploits and resources for other malware.
Point-of-sale terminals are often forgotten about in terms of
segregation and can represent a soft target for attackers. Cisco Talos
recently discovered a new PoS malware that the attackers are selling on
a crimeware forum. Our researchers also discovered the associated
payloads with the malware, its infrastructure and control panel. We
assess with high confidence that this is not the first malware developed
by this actor. A few years ago, they were also pushing the DiamondFox
L!NK botnet. Known as "GlitchPOS," this malware is also being
distributed on alternative websites at a higher price than the
original.  
   
 The actor behind this malware created a video, which we embedded below,
showing how easy it is to use it. This is a case where the average user
could purchase all the tools necessary to set up their own credit
card-skimming botnet.  
   
   
   

GlitchPOS {#h.3x4g00b9czo4}
---------

  

Packer overview

  
 A packer developed in VisualBasic protects this malware. It's, on the
surface, a fake game. The user interface of the main form (which is not
displayed at the execution) contains various pictures of cats:  

[]

  
 The purpose of the packer is to decode a library that's the real
payload encoded with the UPX packer. Once decoded, we gain access to
GlitchPOS, a memory grabber developed in VisualBasic.  
   

Payload analysis

  
 The payload is small and contains only a few functions. It can connect
to a command and control (C2) server to:  
   

-   Register the infected systems

-   Receive tasks (command execution in memory or on disk)
-   Exfiltrate credit card numbers from the memory of the infected
    system
-   Update the exclusion list of scanned processes
-   Update the "encryption" key
-   Update the User Agent
-   Clean itself

  
   

Tasks mechanism

  
 The malware receives tasks from the C2 server. Here is the task pane:  

[]

  
 The commands are executed via a shellcode directly sent by the C2
server. Here is an example in Wireshark:  

[]

  
 The shellcode is encoded with base64. In our screenshot, the shellcode
is a RunPE:  

[]

"Encryption" key

  
 The "encryption" key of the communication can be updated in the panel.
The communication is not encrypted but simply XORed:  

[]

Credit card grabber

  
 The main purpose of this malware is to steal credit card numbers
(Track1 and Track2) from the memory of the infected system. GlitchPOS
uses a regular expression to perform this task:  

[]

  

-   (%B)\d{0,19}\^[\w\s\/]{2,26}\^\d{7}\w*\?  
     The purpose of this regular expression is to detect Track 1 format
    B  
     Here is an example of Track 1:  
     Cardholder : M. TALOS  
     Card number*: 1234 5678 9012 3445  
     Expiration: 01/99  
     %B1234567890123445^TALOS/M.

  

-   ;\d{13,19}=\d{7}\w*\?  
     The purpose of this regular expression is to detect Track 2  
     Here is an example of Track 2 based on the previous example:  
     ;1234567890123445=99011200XXXX00000000?*

  
   
 If a match is identified in memory, the result is sent to the C2
server. The malware maintains an exclusion list provided by the server.
Here is the default list: chrome, firefox, iexplore, svchost, smss,
csrss, wininit, steam, devenv, thunderbird, skype, pidgin, services,
dwn, dllhost, jusched, jucheck, lsass, winlogon, alg, wscntfy, taskmgr,
taskhost, spoolsv, qml, akw.  
   

Panel

  
 Here are some additional screenshots of the GlitchPOS panel. These
screenshots were provided by the seller to promote the malware.  
   
 The "Dashboard:"  

[]

  
 The "Clients" list:  

[]

  
 The "Cards Date:"  

[]

  

Linked with DiamondFox L!NK botnet {#h.5gbso7jx0pp}
----------------------------------

  

Author: Edbitss

  
 The first mention of GlitchPOS was on Feb. 2, 2019 on a malware
forum:  

[]

  
 Edbitss is allegedly the developer of the DiamondFox L!NK botnet in
2015/2016 and 2017 as explained in a report by CheckPoint.   

[]

[]

  
 The developer created this video to promote GlitchPOS, as well. In this
video, you can see the author set up the malware and capture the data
from a swiped card. We apologize for the quality, shakiness, music, and
generally anything else with this video, again, it's not ours.  
   
   
 The built malware is sold for $250, the builder $600 and finally, the
gate address change is charged at $80.  
   

Panel similarities

  
 In addition to the malware language (VisualBasic), we identified
similarities between the DiamondFox panel and the GlitchPOS panel. In
this section, the DiamondPOS screenshots come from the CheckPoint report
mentioned previously.  
   
 Both dashboards' world map are similar (image, code and color):  

[]

  
 The author used the same terminology such ask "Clients" or "Tasks" on
the left menu:  

[]

  
 The icons are the same too in both panels, as well as the infected
machine list (starting with the HWID). The PHP file naming convention is
similar to DiamondFox, too.  
   
 The author clearly reused code from DiamondFox panel on the GlitchPOS
panel.  
   

Comparison of GlitchPOS and the DiamondFox POS module

  
 In 2017, the DiamondFox malware included a POS plugin. We decided to
check if this module was the same as GlitchPOS, but it is not. For
DiamondFox, the author decided to use the leaked code of BlackPOS to
build the credit card grabber. On GlitchPOS, the author developed its
own code to perform this task and did not use the previously leaked
code.  
   

Bad guys are everywhere {#h.azndvmehl885}
-----------------------

  
 It's interesting to see that someone else attempted to push the same
malware 25 days after edbitss on an alternative forum:  

[]

  
 This attacker even tried to cash in by increasing some prices.   

[]

  
 Some members even attempted to call out the unscrupulous behaviour:  

[]

  
 With the different information we have, we think that Chameleon101 has
taken the previous malware created by Edbitss to sell it on an
alternative forum and with a higher price.  

[]

  

Conclusion {#h.nlf8wgwgkc6f}
----------

  
 This investigation shows us that POS malware is still attractive and
some people are still working on the development of this family of
malware. We can see that edbitss developed malware years even after
being publicly mentioned by cybersecurity companies. He left DiamondFox
to switch on a new project targeting point-of-sale. The sale opened a
few weeks ago, so we don't know yet how many people bought it or use it.
We also see that bad guys steal the work of each other and try to sell
malware developed by other developers at a higher price. The final word
will be a quote from Edbitss on a DiamondFox screenshot published by
himself "In the future, even bank robbers will be replaced."
