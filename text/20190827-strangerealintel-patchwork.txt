Malware analysis

Initial vector

The initial vector is an INP file (format used for the software InPage)
with the exploit CVE-2017-12824, we can see here the 0x7E and 0x72
represent a class of type in the stream for use, an ole stream for
launch the first binary file.

[alt text]

We can see on the strings on the dll, what extract the file in the temp
folder and create a thread for the second PE file.

[alt text] [alt text]

On the entrypoint of the second PE, we can see the first action is to
check the environment in using the anti-forensic technique by the
CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent function.

[alt text]

Before go on the others function. We can see that the PE get the name of
the user and create their persistence by an RunOnce key in the registry.
(\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce Putty explorer.exe
CurrentUser C:\file.exe)

After this, this uses the CreateToolhelp32snapshot function for getting
a snapshot of all the process an parsed it until this fall on the
explorer process.

[alt text]

We can note this check with the IsProcessorFeaturePresent function, for
check if and raise an exception for close the program.

[alt text] [alt text] [alt text]

Once the check, this injects with a Process Hollowing for create a
process for communicate with the C2 and wait to loader the next malware.

[alt text]

At the date of the submission in VT, the C2 is down and the next step
can't be analysed.

Cyber kill chain

The process graph resume the cyber kill chain used by the attacker.

Cyber Threat Intel

Firstly, we can observe that the payload seems be with the Professional
version of Inpage (2.21). Inpage is currently used in Pakistan which is
consistent with the fact that Patchwork is an Indian APT.

Secondly, we can note the same pdb path what the 360TI analysis.

The C2 is hosted on Amazon CloudFront :

  IP             Hostname                                    Route            ASN       Organization       Country         City      Region       Coordinates

This payload is linked at one of the recent events :

-   A Delegation of Pakistan Naval Academy visits Azerbaijan (5 April
    2019) [alt text]
-   The visit of Pakistan Air Force Academy delegation in Azerbaijan (20
    June 2019) [alt text]

found matching with it is Scripting.
