APT reports

Operation ShadowHammer {.entry-title}
======================

By GReAT, AMR on March 25, 2019. 1:01 pm

Earlier today, Motherboard published a story by Kim Zetter on Operation
ShadowHammer, a newly discovered supply chain attack that leveraged ASUS
Live Update software.

While the investigation is still in progress and full results and
technical paper will be published during SAS 2019 conference in
Singapore, we would like to share some important details about the
attack.

In January 2019, we discovered a sophisticated supply chain attack
involving the ASUS Live Update Utility. The attack took place between
June and November 2018 and according to our telemetry, it affected a
large number of users.

ASUS Live Update is an utility that is pre-installed on most ASUS
computers and is used to automatically update certain components such as
BIOS, UEFI, drivers and applications. According to Gartner, ASUS is the
world’s 5th-largest PC vendor by 2017 unit sales. This makes it an
extremely attractive target for APT groups that might want to take
advantage of their userbase.

Based on our statistics, over 57,000 Kaspersky users have downloaded and
installed the backdoored version of ASUS Live Update at some point in
time. We are not able to calculate the total count of affected users
based only on our data; however, we estimate that the real scale of the
problem is much bigger and is possibly affecting over a million users
worldwide.

Thegoal of the attack was to surgically target an unknown pool of users,
which were identified by their network adapters’ MAC addresses. To
achieve this, the attackers had hardcoded a list of MAC addresses in the
trojanized samples and this list was used to identify the actual
intended targets of this massive operation. We were able to extract more
than 600 unique MAC addresses from over 200 samples used in this attack.
Of course, there might be other samples out there with different MAC
addresses in their list.

We believe this to be a very sophisticated supply chain attack, which
matches or even surpasses the Shadowpad and the CCleaner incidents in
complexity and techniques. The reason that it stayed undetected for so
long is partly due to the fact that the trojanized updaters were signed
with legitimate certificates (eg: “ASUSTeK Computer Inc.”). The
malicious updaters were hosted on the official liveupdate01s.asus[.]com
and liveupdate01.asus[.]com ASUS update servers.

[]

 Certificate serial number: 05e6a0be5ac359c7ff11f4b467ab20fc

We have contacted ASUS and informed them about the attack on Jan 31,
2019, supporting their investigation with IOCs and descriptions of the
malware.

Although precise attribution is not available at the moment, certain
evidence we have collected allows us to link this attack to the
ShadowPad incident from 2017. The actor behind the ShadowPad incident
has been publicly identified by Microsoft in court documents as BARIUM.
BARIUM is an APT actor known to be using the Winnti backdoor. Recently,
our colleagues from ESET wrote about another supply chain attack in
which BARIUM was also involved, that we believe is connected to this
case as well.

A victim distribution by country for the compromised ASUS Live Updater
looks as follows:

[]

It should be noted that the numbers are also highly influenced by the
distribution of Kaspersky users around the world. In principle, the
distribution of victims should match the distribution of ASUS users
around the world.

We’ve also created a tool which can be run to determine if your computer
has been one of the surgically selected targets of this attack. To check
this, it compares MAC addresses of all adapters to a list of predefined
values hardcoded in the malware and alerts if a match was found.

Download an archive with the tool (.exe)

Also, you may check MAC addresses online. If you discover that you have
been targeted by this operation, please e-mail us at:

    Any idea if ASUS wireless routers were affected by this as well? I
    noticed in that same time frame that several of these that I manage
    required multiple reboots to resolve wireless connectivity issues
    (wireless signal dropping unexpectedly, unexplained slow internet
    speeds, etc) when previously these were behaving perfectly.

        I have experienced the same issue with my router Asus and the
        AImesh routers i have. and it seems some clients are not yet
        connected.  
         I was expecting my local Wifi to not be “controlled” by Asus
        servers …. not sure if i’m now confident with Asus anymore.

        Im wondering the same thing. Luckily ALL 5 of my ASUS
        motherboard PCs arent infected, as well as my ASUS laptop. But
        ironically I had bought a brand new ASUS router last year
        (RT-N66u) and it happened to be one of the very few routers that
        were one of the models to get their Firmware infected with
        malware (possibly even having the malware on the router when I
        bought it brand new from newegg.com ) Definitely not neweggs
        fault , but kinda scary knowing that other people and possibly
        mine as well were shipped brand new with the infected firmware
        that could be dormant for an indefinite amount of time and then
        enabled remotely one day to start relaying data to Russia etc.
        AKa using peoples bandwidth to turn their network into a botnet
        to give them access to a very large amount of routers to use at
        their disposal for DDoS attacks etc.

            This was an exploit to the Asus Live Update software for
            their Laptops. If this program was uninstalled or not
            updated after the hack occurred you wouldn’t be affected.

    So the DOC grabs their fall guy from ShadowPad 2017 and points the
    finger at BARIUM to support Russian collusion! Amazing how much
    Russia comes up these days.

    My friend’s laptop was affected by this virus in January and after
    that, his laptop was unable to boot properly. Neither he was able to
    install a fresh copy of Linux. Is there any solution to it, if
    anyone knows any then please tell me.

    Is the second HASH recorded actually 2 hashes? Should it read:

        No, there are MD5 and SHA256 hashes of the archive.

    Is it possible that the certificate was left on a server, and then
    used to sign the malware making it look legitimate? so perhaps ASUS
    should have secured their certificates better?

    I have been fighting this virus for over 10 years. Everyone i
    contacted all told me that a BIOS could not get malware. I built a
    system using an Asus MB that keep losing its MBR. I reflashed the
    BIOS and reload Win 7 and it would run as long as you didn’t reboot
    then I would lose the MBR again. I could see sector 0 was corrupted
    and copied into hundreds of other sectors. Had to wipe and zero out
    the entire HD and try again. New HD did no better. I figured it had
    to coming from the BIOS and contacted Asus. They had me send my MB
    to them upon they swapped a new BIOS chip on it. Upon reinstalling
    it, it ran fine for a short time and then just did the same thing
    again. I contacted Asus and they sent me a brand new MB which also
    ran fine for a a short time. I still have the 2 MBs and the Asus
    BIOS flash software. this malware also writes to any write-able
    software.
