Analysis of the Attack of Mobile Devices by OceanLotus
------------------------------------------------------

August 01, 2019 By Antiy PTA Team Security Response -

1、Background

* * * * *

OceanLotus (also known as apt-tocs, APT32) is considered to be an APT
group from a country on Indo-China Peninsula. Since it was active in
2012, it has been carrying out attacks against sensitive targets in
China and is one of the most active APT attack organizations targeting
mainland China in recent years.

Previously, Antiy and other security vendors have published a number of
analysis reports on OceanLotus, focusing mainly on the PC side. The
attack methods are mainly based on spear and phishing attacks, and
mobile attacks are rare. However, with the development of the mobile
Internet, on the one hand, people’s mobile phones gradually become
dual-use. In addition to the personal privacy of users, they often have
their social attributes. On the other hand, wireless communication of
smartphones can bypass the internal safety regulation devices, so the
attack on the mobile side has become an important part of the entire
attack chain. Below, Antiy Mobile Security use the mobile-side attack
incidents that occurred in China as a blueprint for specific analysis
and explanation.

2、Details analysis

com.android.wps

[]

Table 2-1 Basic information of a typical sample

These applications disguise as a normal application, and their icons
will hide automatically after they are running. They will release
malicious sub-packages in the background, receive the remote control
command, steal the privacy information of users such as SMS messages,
contacts, call records, geographic locations, and browser records. They
also download apks secretly and record audios and videos, then upload
users’ privacy information to server, causing users’ privacy leakage.

3、Sample analysis

The application will open the LicenseService service after startup:

The service will open the f thread for registering and releasing spy
sub-packages:

Subpackage analysis:

The main package reflects the Execute method of the
com.android.preferences.AndroidR class:

[]

First establish a socket connection:

[]

Socket address: mtk.baimind.com

Set up communication with mobile phone, send control instructions and
upload some private information such as SMS, contact, call record,
geographical location and browser record.

[]

In addition, the spy sub-package also established https communication
for uploading large files such as recordings, screenshots, documents,
photos, videos.

Https address:

at present, and the C2 belongs to the assets of the OceanLotus
organization.

Table 3-1 The location and function of CC

As shown in the following figure: First, the signature Subject contains
the words HackingTeam and Christian Pozz (the name of an administrator
in the Hacking Team); secondly, the registration function in the code
can be considered as commercial spyware for sale; finally, according to
the late Hacking According to Team’s leaked information, the country
OceanLotus affiliated with is also on the list of its customers.

4、Extended analysis

* * * * *

Based on the homology of the registered CC, we find the following
sample:

Table 4-1 Homologous samples retrieved by CC

Different from the samples we analyzed before, the above samples have
obvious functional improvements, and the privilege escalation has been
added. Taking 45AE1CB1596E538220CA99B29816304F as an example, the file
named dataOff.db in the assets directory is decrypted, and the file
after decryption has the privilege escalation. The configuration file
looks like this:

[]

It can be seen that after the code leakage, the CEO of the HackingTeam
organization said that "the leaked code is only a small part" is based
on the facts, which also reflects that the network arms merchants have
lowered the threshold of APT attacks to a certain extent, making more
uncertainties of cyber attacks.

At the same time, we also noticed that the series of malicious code has
been delivered through the domestic third-party application market and
file sharing website.

5、Conclusion

* * * * *

The OceanLotus is always evolving and constantly updating its attack
techniques and arsenal to achieve the goal of bypassing security
software. In addition to the constant updating of the arsenal, the
organization is quite knowledgeable about China, including the policies
and usage habits. This not only confuses the relevant personnel,
increases the success rate of their attacks, but also brings
immeasurable losses to the target victim groups. Therefore, for
individuals, it is necessary to effectively raise the awareness of
network security and not be blinded by phishing information. For
security vendors, it is more necessary to deepen their understanding and
continue to conduct targeted confrontation and improve security
protection capabilities, truly escort for mobile security of the user
side.
