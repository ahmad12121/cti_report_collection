Chinese APT “Operation LagTime IT” Targets Government Information

Chinese APT “Operation LagTime IT” Targets Government Information Technology Agencies in Eastern Asia {.blog-banner__heading .container}
=====================================================================================================

Rss

July 24, 2019

Michael Raggi and Dennis Schwarz with the Proofpoint Threat Insight Team

Overview

Proofpoint researchers have identified a targeted APT campaign that
utilized malicious RTF documents to deliver custom malware to
unsuspecting victims. We dubbed this campaign “Operation LagTime IT”
based on entities that were targeted and the distinctive domains
registered to C&C IP infrastructure.

Beginning in early 2019, these threat actors targeted a number of
government agencies in East Asia overseeing government information
technology, domestic affairs, foreign affairs, economic development, and
political processes. We determined that the infection vector observed in
this campaign was spear phishing, with emails originating from both free
email accounts and compromised user accounts. Attackers relied on
Microsoft Equation Editor exploit CVE-2018-0798 to deliver a custom
malware that Proofpoint researchers have dubbed Cotx RAT.

Additionally, this APT group utilizes Poison Ivy payloads that share
overlapping command and control (C&C) infrastructure with the newly
identified Cotx campaigns. Based on infrastructure overlaps,
post-exploitation techniques, and historic TTPs utilized in this
operation, Proofpoint analysts attribute this activity to the Chinese
APT group tracked internally as TA428. Researchers believe that this
activity has an operational and tactical resemblance to the Maudi
Surveillance Operation which was previously reported in 2013 [1].

Delivery

Proofpoint researchers initially identified email campaigns with
malicious RTF document attachments targeting East Asian government
agencies in March 2019. These campaigns originated from
adversary-operated free email sender accounts at yahoo[.]co[.].jp and
yahoo[.]com. Sender addresses often imitated common names found in the
languages of targeted entities. Spear phishing emails included malicious
.doc attachments that were actually RTF files saved with .doc file
extensions.

The lures used in the subjects, attachment names, and attachment content
in several cases utilized information technology themes specific to Asia
such as governmental or public training documents relating to IT. On one
specific occasion an email utilized the subject “ITU Asia-Pacific Online
CoE Training Course on ‘Conformity & Interoperability in 5G’ for the
Asia-Pacific Region, 15-26 April 2019” and the attachment name
“190315_annex 1 online_course_agenda_coei_c&i.doc”. The conference
referenced in the lure was an actual event likely selected due to its
relevance to potential victims. This is significant as countries in the
APAC region continue to adopt Chinese 5G technology in government as
well as heavy equipment industries.

[]

We identified several government agencies targeted as part of Operation
LagTime IT. These agencies are responsible for overseeing IT, scientific
research, domestic affairs, foreign affairs, political processes, and
financial development.

Exploitation

As we previously noted, the malicious RTF attachments exploited
vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Equation Editor, specifically
CVE-2018-0798, before downloading subsequent payloads. The exploit uses
an encoded RTF object to drop a PE file to the Windows temporary
directory. The dropped PE file has the distinctive file name “8.t”. When
executed, writes a Word Add-In file with the “.wll” extension to the
Windows Startup directory, which runs the next time Word is opened. It
should be noted that this dropper methodology is not unique to TA428,
and has been identified by security researchers in campaigns related to
at least four additional Chinese APT groups. RTF files leveraging this
technique have historically contained the string
"objw871\\objh811\\objscalex8\\objscaley8" which has been noted by
researchers at Anomali [2] and FireEye. Researchers have also recently
observed this RTF weaponizer tool in commodity campaigns delivering
Async RAT.

After it is executed, the .wll file renames itself as RasTls.dll.
Simultaneously, it decrypts a legitimate Symantec PE binary commonly
named IntelGraphicsController.exe or AcroRd32.exe. This legitimate
Symantec binary is used to side-load RasTls.dll using DLL search-order
hijacking leading to the execution of Cotx RAT malware. Once executed
the RasTls.dll file next resolves the addresses of the DLL libraries it
is programmed to access and ensures that it is only running in one of
five predetermined processes. These processes are winword.exe,
excel.exe, powerpnt.exe, eqnedt32.exe, and acrord32.exe. The first four
of these processes are associated with Microsoft Word, Excel, and
PowerPoint exploits, as well as the Equation Editor exploit used by the
initial malicious RTF in this campaign. The last process is utilized as
part of the loading process for Cotx RAT and involves the legitimate
Symantec binary noted above. The inclusion of the processes excel.exe
and powerpnt.exe suggests that this stage one malware may be capable of
utilizing .xls and .ppsx files as droppers. Researchers at SectorB06 [4]
have noted this stage-one payload and indicated that throughout the
above process it is running a “CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent” function to
prevent analysis and debugging by researchers.

Malware: Cotx RAT

The RasTls.dll contains the Cotx RAT code. The malware is written in C++
using object-oriented programming. We named it by borrowing the name of
the location of its stored configuration. The encrypted configuration is
stored in the side-loaded DLL file RasTls.dll in a PE section named
“.cotx”. The current encrypted configuration is also stored in the
registry key “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Intel\Java\user”.

The configuration data is AES-192-encrypted using CBC mode and
base64-encoded. We determined that the encryption key was
"98151137ab12780969b2c3612072018709a83a3352466a8b" (hex-encoded) and the
initialization vector “IV” was “2042123224315117031b1a0a3ccda53f”
(hex-encoded). In plaintext the configuration appears as follows:

    *\x00\x00\x00217.69.8.255|||1.187.1.187|mark3|P@SSaw1||\x00\x00

    The first four bytes contain the size of the configuration (42-bytes). The configuration is pipe delimited and contains:

1.  C&C host 1
2.  C&C host 2
3.  C&C host 3
4.  Definition of two C&C ports  
    1.  An example string looks like an IP address: "1.187.1.187"
    2.  The string is split on "."
    3.  Port 1 is defined by (piece0 << 8) + piece1 = (1 << 8) + 187 =
        443
    4.  Port 2 is defined by (piece2 << 8) + piece3 = (1 << 8) + 187 =
        443
    5.  Alternatively, if the string is not an IP address, but looks
        like a host, it will resolve the host into an IP address and
        calculate the ports using the resolved address

5.  "mark" field - sent in the C&C beacon
6.  "passwd" field - sent in the C&C beacon
7.  Proxy IP and port  
    1.  Discovered by searching the IPv4 TCP connection table for
        established connections with remote ports using common proxy
        ports (3128, 8080, 808, 1080)
    2.  Or via WINHTTP_OPTION_PROXY

For persistence, Cotx stores files in a directory “Intel\Intel(R)
Processor Graphics”. The location of this folder varies among samples
with both the %AppData% and %PROGRAMFILES% directories being observed.

The command and control structure of Cotx RAT is proxy aware. It
utilizes wolfSSL for TLS encrypted communication. The initial beacon
contains “|”-delimited system information. The data included in the
beacon is Zlib compressed and encrypted with AES-192 in CBC mode
utilizing the same keys as the configuration. The following values are
included:

-   "id" value from "software\\intel\\java" subkey
-   Computer name
-   "mark" field from configuration
-   Username
-   Windows version
-   Architecture
-   Possible malware version. "0.9.7" is hardcoded in the analyzed
    sample
-   Local IP addresses
-   First adapter's MAC address
-   Connection type (https or _proxy)
-   "password" field from configuration

Commands from the C&C are received from the malware beacon. This data is
AES-encrypted. We observed the following commands:

-   0 - Keep alive, sets a "poll again" flag and sends an empty response
    to C&C
-   1 - Sets "id" value in "software\\intel\\java" subkey, sends an
    empty response to C&C
-   2 - Get directory info or drive info
-   5 - Open command shell
-   6 - Open command shell as logged in user
-   7 - Send command to command shell
-   8 - Copy file
-   9 - Delete file
-   10 - Read file
-   11 - Check for filename. If doesn't exist, check for filename with
    ".ut" extension. If it exists, send file size back to C&C
-   12 - Write file
-   13 - Screenshot
-   14 - Process listing
-   15 - Kill process
-   16 - Send current configuration to C&C
-   17 - Update config in registry and ".cotx" PE section
-   18 - Set sleep time
-   19 - Close C&C comms
-   20 - Uninstall and remove self
-   21 - Get list of installed software
-   22 - Kill command shell
-   23 - Exit malware
-   24 - Send a "Ctrl-C" to the command shell and exit
-   25 - Execute an executable

Malware: Poison Ivy

TA428 threat actors also delivered Poison Ivy malware payloads. In a
limited number of cases, we observed attachments utilizing the 8.t
dropper methodology described above. However, the majority of Poison Ivy
payloads were dropped as PE files named OSE.exe when the RTF attachment
was executed and an Equation Editor vulnerability was successfully
exploited. The Poison Ivy samples all communicated with the IP
95.179.131[.]29. We identified earlier variants of Poison Ivy malware
that utilized the above IP via open source research, which used the file
names bubbles.exe and sfx.exe. Examination of the Poison Ivy malware
configurations indicated that all samples shared the password
“3&U<9f*lZ>!MIQ” while campaign and group IDs, as well as mutexes varied
across campaigns.

We identified significant operational overlap between Cotx RAT campaigns
and Poison Ivy campaigns. Specifically, on several occasions users that
were unsuccessfully targeted with Cotx RAT malware were later targeted
with messages distributing Poison Ivy. Users were also targeted by
Poison Ivy malware on successive occasions indicating the adversary’s
persistent nature in attempting to compromise targets via spear
phishing. In one example, a targeted user received an unsuccessful
phishing email attempting to deliver Cotx RAT followed by a Poison Ivy
phishing email seven days later. In addition to a shared targeting list,
analysts observed adversary reuse of free email sender accounts to
deliver both Cotx RAT and Poison Ivy malware to different users. It
appears the adversary sender accounts utilized delivery TTPs and
payloads interchangeably from March through April 2019. This vacillation
of tactics further enforces Proofpoint’s classification of these
campaigns under a single operation.

C&C Infrastructure

An examination of the separate C&C infrastructure utilized by Cotx RAT
and Poison Ivy payloads revealed further overlaps between these
campaigns. A review of passive DNS information indicated that the C&C
IPs hosted subdomains that share the root domain vzglagtime[.]net. We
found that the Poison Ivy C&C IP hosted the domains
f1news[.]vzglagtime[.]net and news[.]vzglagtime[.]net. The Cotx RAT C&C
IP hosted the hostname mtanews.vzglagtime[.]net. The latter of these
domains was previously reported by security researchers to have been a
C&C address observed in a malware implant targeting the East Asian
Telecommunications and Transportation sectors in January 2019. The
presence of related domain registrations on disparate malware IP
infrastructure also contributed to analysts’ decision to classify these
campaigns collectively under Operation LagTime IT.

Conclusion

Proofpoint analysts assess that Operation LagTime IT is likely a
continuation of targeted activity by APT actors aligned with Chinese
state interests. This operation, centered around East Asian governmental
agencies, may represent efforts to satisfy espionage and intelligence
requirements relative to China’s regional neighbors. While not
revolutionary in its approach or malware design, TA428 actors
demonstrated significant persistence in compromising victims and
utilized custom malware. The defined scope of targeting in this
operation including government information technology agencies
demonstrates a focus on high-value targets. While ultimately the
motivation for this APT campaign remains opaque, what is certain is that
TA428 persists in targeting users responsible for the orchestration of
governmental systems in East Asia.
