We found new campaigns that appear to wear the badge of MuddyWater.
Analysis of these campaigns revealed the use of new tools and payloads,
which indicates that the well-known threat actor group is continuously
developing their schemes. We also unearthed and detailed our other
findings on MuddyWater, such as its connection to four Android malware
variants and its use of false flag techniques, among others, in our
report “New MuddyWater Activities Uncovered: Threat Actors Used
Multi-Stage Backdoors, False Flags, Android Malware, and More.”

One of the campaigns sent spear-phishing emails to a university in
Jordan and the Turkish government. The said legitimate entities’ sender
addresses were not spoofed to deceive email recipients. Instead, the
campaign used compromised legitimate accounts to trick victims into
installing malware.

office, dated April 8, 2019.

Figure 2. Email headers showing the origin of the spear-phishing email

Our analysis revealed that the threat actor group deployed a new
multi-stage PowerShell-based backdoor called POWERSTATS v3 (detected by
Trend Micro as Trojan.PS1.POWERSTATS.C). The spear-phishing email that
contains a document embedded with a malicious macro drops a VBE file
encoded with Microsoft Script Encoder. The VBE file, which holds a
base64-encoded block of data containing obfuscated PowerShell script,
will then execute. This block of data will be decoded and saved to the
%PUBLIC% directory under various names ending with image file extensions
such as .jpeg and .png. The PowerShell code will then use custom string
obfuscation and useless code blocks to make it difficult to analyze.

[]

The final backdoor code is revealed after the deobfuscation of all
strings and removal of all unnecessary code. But first, the backdoor
will acquire the operating system (OS) information and save the result
to a log file.

[]

Figure 4. Code snippet of OS information collection

This file will be uploaded to the command and control (C&C) server. Each
victim machine will generate a random GUID number, which will be used
for machine identification. Later on, the malware variant will start the
endless loop, querying for the GUID-named file in a certain folder on
the C&C server. If such a file is found, it will be downloaded and
executed using the Powershell.exe process.

A second stage attack can be launched by commands sent to a specific
victim in an asynchronous way, e.g., another backdoor payload can be
downloaded and installed to targets that they are interested in.

[]

stage

We were able to analyze a case where the group launched a second stage
attack. The group was able to download another backdoor, which is
supported by the following commands:

-   Take screenshots
-   Command execution via the cmd.exe binary
-   If there’s no keyword, the malware variant assumes that the input is
    PowerShell code and executes it via the “Invoke-Expression” cmdlet

[]

screenshot command

The C&C communication is done using PHP scripts with a hardcoded token
and a set of backend functions such as sc (screenshot), res(result of
executed command), reg (register new victim), and uDel(self-delete after
an error).

on the C&C server, trying to download a GUID-named file with commands to
execute.

Other MuddyWater campaigns in the first half of 2019

The MuddyWater threat actor group has been actively targeting victims
with a variety of tricks, and they seem to keep on adding more as they
move forward with new campaigns. The campaign that used POWERSTATS v3 is
not the only one we found with new tricks. We observed other campaigns
that changed their delivery methods and dropped file types. Notably,
these campaigns have also changed payloads and publicly available
post-exploitation tools.

  ----------------- ------------------------------------ ----------------------- ---------------------
  Discovery Date    Method for dropping malicious code   Type of files dropped   Final payload
  2019-01           Macros                               EXE                     SHARPSTATS

  ----------------- ------------------------------------ ----------------------- ---------------------

Table 1. MuddyWater’s delivery methods and payloads in 2019 1H

In January 2019, we discovered that the campaign started using
SHARPSTATS (Trojan.Win32.SHARPSTATS.A), a .NET-written backdoor that
supports DOWNLOAD, UPLOAD, and RUN functions. In the same month,
DELPHSTATS (Trojan.Win32.DELPSTATS.A),a backdoor written in the Delphi
programming language, emerged. DELPHSTATS queries the C&C server for a
.dat file before executing it via the Powershell.exe process. Like
SHARPSTATS, DELPHSTATS employs custom PowerShell script with code
similarities to the one embedded into the former.

[]

Figure 8. SHARPSTATS can be used to collect system information by
dropping and executing a PowerShell script.

Figure 9. The code in DELPHSTATS that queries a certain directory on the
C&C server. It’s where operators upload additional payload.

We came across the heavily obfuscated POWERSTATS v2
(Trojan.PS1.POWERSTATS.B) in March 2019. An earlier version of this
backdoor decodes the initial encoded/compressed blocks of code, while an
improved version appeared later on. The latter heavily uses format
strings and redundant backtick characters. The function names in the
earlier version were still somehow readable, but they were completely
randomized in later versions.

[]

Figure 10. Obfuscated POWERSTATS v2

After deobfuscation, the main backdoor loop queries different URLs for a
“Hello server” message to obtain command and upload the result of the
run command to the C&C server.

Use of different post-exploitation tools

We also observed MuddyWater’s use of multiple open source
post-exploitation tools, which they deployed after successfully
compromising a target.

  ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------
  Name of the Post-Exploitation Tool   Programming language/Interpreter
  CrackMapExec                         Python, PyInstaller
  ChromeCookiesView                    Executable file
  chrome-passwords                     Executable file
  EmpireProject                        PowerShell, Python
  FruityC2                             PowerShell
  Koadic                               JavaScript
  LaZagne                              Python, PyInstaller
  Meterpreter                          Reflective loader, executable file
  Mimikatz                             Executable file
  MZCookiesView                        Executable file
  PowerSploit                          PowerShell
  Shootback                            Python, PyInstaller
  Smbmap                               Python, PyInstaller
  ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------

Table 2. Tools used by MuddyWater campaigns over the years.

One campaign stands out for its use of the LaZagne credential dumper,
which was patched to drop and run POWERSTATS in the main function.

Figure 12. LaZagne has been patched to drop and run POWERSTATS in the
main function. See added intimoddumpers() function. Note the typo in the
function name – its INTI, not INIT.

Conclusion and security recommendations

While MuddyWater appears to have no access to zero-days and advanced
malware variants, it still managed to compromise its targets. This can
be attributed to the constant development of their schemes.

Notably, the group’s use of email as an infection vector seems to yield
success for their campaigns. In this regard, apart from using smart
email security solutions, organizations should inform their employees of
ways to stay safe from email threats.

Organizations can also take advantage of Trend Micro™ Deep Discovery™, a
solution that provides detection, in-depth analysis, and proactive
response to today’s stealthy malware and targeted attacks in real time.
It provides a comprehensive defense tailored to protect organizations
against targeted attacks and advanced threats through specialized
engines, custom sandboxing, and seamless correlation across the entire
attack lifecycle, allowing it to detect threats even without any engine
or pattern updates.

Updated the blog and technical brief on June 26, 2019 to add detection
names and retract information about a malicious document initially
attributed to MuddyWater.

Business Process Compromise

-   Attackers are starting to invest in long-term operations that target
    specific processes enterprises rely on. They scout for vulnerable
    practices, susceptible systems and operational loopholes that they
    can leverage or abuse. To learn more, read our Security 101:
