Report: OceanLotus APT Group Leveraging Steganography {#page_title}
=====================================================

During an incident response investigation in the final quarter of 2017,
BlackBerry Cylance incident responders and threat researchers uncovered
several bespoke backdoors deployed by the OceanLotus APT Group (a.k.a.
APT32, Cobalt Kitty), as well as evidence of the threat actor using
obfuscated CobaltStrike Beacon payloads to perform command and control
(C2).

[]While continuing to monitor activity of the OceanLotus APT Group, our
researchers uncovered a novel payload loader that utilizes steganography
to read an encrypted payload concealed within a .png image file.

The steganography algorithm appears to be bespoke and utilizes a least
significant bit approach to minimize visual differences when compared
with the original image to prevent analysis by discovery tools.

Once decoded, decrypted, and executed, an obfuscated loader will load
one of the APT32 backdoors.

Thus far, BlackBerry Cylance has observed two backdoors being used in
combination with the steganography loader – a version of Denes backdoor
(bearing similarities to the one described by ESET), and an updated
version of Remy backdoor.

However, this can be easily modified by the threat actor to deliver
other malicious payloads. The complexity of the shellcode and loaders
shows the group continues to invest heavily in development of bespoke
tooling.

This new white paper describes the steganography algorithm used in two
distinct loader variants and looks at the launcher of the backdoor that
was encoded in one of the .png cover images.
