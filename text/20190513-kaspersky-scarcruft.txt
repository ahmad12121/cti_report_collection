ScarCruft continues to evolve, introduces Bluetooth harvester {.entry-title}
=============================================================

By GReAT on May 13, 2019. 10:00 am

Executive summary
-----------------

After publishing our initial series of blogposts back in 2016, we have
continued to track the ScarCruft threat actor. ScarCruft is a
Korean-speaking and allegedly state-sponsored threat actor that usually
targets organizations and companies with links to the Korean peninsula.
The threat actor is highly skilled and, by all appearances, quite
resourceful.

We recently discovered some interesting telemetry on this actor, and
decided to dig deeper into ScarCruft’s recent activity. This shows that
the actor is still very active and constantly trying to elaborate its
attack tools. Based on our telemetry, we can reassemble ScarCruft’s
binary infection procedure. It used a multi-stage binary infection to
update each module effectively and evade detection. In addition, we
analyzed the victims of this campaign and spotted an interesting overlap
of this campaign with another APT actor known as DarkHotel.

Multi-stage binary infection
----------------------------

The ScarCruft group uses common malware delivery techniques such as
spear phishing and Strategic Web Compromises (SWC). As in Operation
Daybreak, this actor performs sophisticated attacks using a zero-day
exploit. However, sometimes using public exploit code is quicker and
more effective for malware authors. We witnessed this actor extensively
testing a known public exploit during its preparation for the next
campaign.

In order to deploy an implant for the final payload, ScarCruft uses a
multi-stage binary infection scheme. As a rule, the initial dropper is
created by the infection procedure. One of the most notable functions of
the initial dropper is to bypass Windows UAC (User Account Control) in
order to execute the next payload with higher privileges. This malware
uses the public privilege escalation exploit code CVE-2018-8120 or UACME
which is normally used by legitimate red teams. Afterwards, the
installer malware creates a downloader and a configuration file from its
resource and executes it. The downloader malware uses the configuration
file and connects to the C2 server to fetch the next payload. In order
to evade network level detection, the downloader uses steganography. The
downloaded payload is an image file, but it contains an appended
malicious payload to be decrypted.

[]

Multi-stage binary infection

The final payload created by the aforementioned process is a well known
backdoor, also known as ROKRAT by Cisco Talos. This cloud service-based
backdoor contains many features. One of its main functions is to steal
information. Upon execution, this malware creates 10 random directory
paths and uses them for a specially designated purpose. The malware
creates 11 threads simultaneously: six threads are responsible for
stealing information from the infected host, and five threads are for
forwarding collected data to four cloud services (Box, Dropbox, Pcloud
and Yandex). When uploading stolen data to a cloud service, it uses
predefined directory path such as /english, /video or /scriptout.

[]

Cloud-based backdoor

The same malware contains full-featured backdoor functionality. The
commands are downloaded from the /script path of a cloud service
provider and the respective execution results are uploaded to the
/scriptout path. It supports the following commands, which are enough to
fully control the infected host:

-   Get File/Process listing
-   Download additional payload and execute
-   Execute Windows command
-   Update configuration data including cloud service token information
-   Save screenshot and an audio recording

The ScarCruft group keeps expanding its exfiltration targets to steal
further information from infected hosts and continues to create tools
for additional data exfiltration. During our research, we confirmed that
they have an interest in mobile devices.

We also discovered an interesting piece of rare malware created by this
threat actor – a Bluetooth device harvester. This malware is responsible
for stealing Bluetooth device information. It is fetched by a
downloader, and collects information directly from the infected host.
This malware uses Windows Bluetooth APIs to find information on
connected Bluetooth devices and saves the following information.

-   Instance Name: Name of device
-   Address: Address of device
-   Class: Class of the device
-   Connected: Whether the device is connected(true or false)
-   Authenticated: Whether the device is authenticated(true or false)
-   Remembered: Whether the device is a remembered device(true or false)

The attackers appear to be increasing the scope of the information
collected from victims.

Victimology
-----------

We have found several victims of this campaign, based on our telemetry –
investment and trading companies in Vietnam and Russia. We believe they
may have some links to North Korea, which may explain why ScarCruft
decided to closely monitor them. ScarCruft also attacked a diplomatic
agency in Hong Kong, and another diplomatic agency in North Korea. It
appears ScarCruft is primarily targeting intelligence for political and
diplomatic purposes.

[]

Victimology of this campaign

Overlap with other actors
-------------------------

We discovered one victim from Russia that also triggered a malware
detection while staying in North Korea in the past. The fact that this
victim visits North Korea makes its special and suggests that it may
have valuable information about North Korean affairs. ScarCruft infected
this victim on September 21, 2018. But before the ScarCruft infection,
however, another APT group also targeted this victim with the host being
infected with GreezeBackdoor on March 26, 2018.

GreezeBackdoor is a tool of the DarkHotel APT group, which we have
previously written about. In addition, this victim was also attacked by
the Konni malware on 03 April 2018. The Konni malware was disguised as a
North Korean news item in a weaponized documents (the name of the
document was “Why North Korea slams South Korea’s recent defense talks
with U.S-Japan.zip”)

[]

Infection timeline

This is not the first time we have seen an overlap of ScarCruft and
DarkHotel actors. Members from our team have already presented on the
conflict of these two threat actors at security conferences. We have
also shared more details with our threat intelligence customers in the
past. They are both Korean-speaking threat actors and sometimes their
victimology overlaps. But both group seem to have different TTPs
(Tactics, Techniques and Procedures) and it leads us to believe that one
group regularly lurks in the other’s shadow.

Conclusions
-----------

The ScarCruft has shown itself to be a highly-skilled and active group.
It has a keen interest in North Korean affairs, attacking those in the
business sector who may have any connection to North Korea, as well as
diplomatic agencies around the globe. Based on the ScarCruft’s recent
activities, we strongly believe that this group is likely to continue to
evolve. For more information please contact: intelreports@kaspersky.com
