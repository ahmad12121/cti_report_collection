Malware analysis

Initial vector

The initial PE extract the fake document and a second PE which create a
Run key as persistence, extract the legit ESET 5 RAT and the hijacking
dll and shellcode to execute (by folder permissions).

Here, we can see the persistence (Run key) for the dropper.

[alt text]

This detect if the persistence is already pushed and edit the status of
key in reedit the key.

[alt text]

This use the RichEdit function for push the data on the documentused as
leur for decoy the victims.

[alt text]

Once this did, this executes it and waits for the command of the
attacker.

ESET Remote Administrator

The new PE file is ESET Remote Administrator, we can see the
verification of the validation of the certificate.

[alt text]

This key is after used on the cryptographic function for crypt and
encypt the differents parts of the legit tool.

[alt text]

This load after the xml configuration for the global parameters on the
ESET software, this manage the service of the RAT and the status if need
it.

[alt text]

All this things prove the utilisation of the legit RAT tool of ESET at
the malicious usage by the attackers.

Hijacking DLL

The dll prepare the shellcode with a localAlloc (content in the dat
file).

[alt text]

After push it in the memory, this protect it with a Virtualprotect.

[alt text]

We can see all the events on do by the hijacking DLL.

[alt text]

Cyber kill chain

The process graph resume the cyber kill chain used by the attacker.

[alt text]

Cyber Threat Intel

The malware is as well-know RAT, PlugX current used since 2012 on the
Chinese APT group.The domain used as C2 is based in Canada by the cloud
provider GoDaddy.

[alt text]

The information put in the domain register has a Chinese provenance.

[alt text]

This operation is done by the Chinese APT group(s) after the visit of
the U.S. National Security Advisor in Mongolia about the national
security concept.

[alt text]

The document are a compiled of muliple documents about the national
security concept available on the web.

[alt text]

The others samples are leurs against Jaish group who have recently
infiltrate Kashmir. Pakistan and China cooperate against the Jaish
Association who have increased since the attack foiled in November 2018
against the Chinese consulate. This infiltration on the Jaish group on
the Kashmir has give all the cyberattacks who have analysed and military
deployments observed by d-atis between Pakistan, India and China since
the last 2 months.
