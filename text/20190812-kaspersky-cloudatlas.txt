Recent Cloud Atlas activity {.entry-title}
===========================

By GReAT on August 12, 2019. 10:00 am

Also known as Inception, Cloud Atlas is an actor that has a long history
of cyber-espionage operations targeting industries and governmental
entities. We first reported Cloud Atlas in 2014 and we’ve been following
its activities ever since.

From the beginning of 2019 until July, we have been able to identify
different spear-phishing campaigns related to this threat actor mostly
focused on Russia, Central Asia and regions of Ukraine with ongoing
military conflicts.

[]

Countries targeted by Cloud Atlas recently

Cloud Atlas hasn’t changed its TTPs (Tactic Tools and Procedures) since
2018 and is still relying on its effective existing tactics and malware
in order to compromise high value targets.

The Windows branch of the Cloud Atlas intrusion set still uses
spear-phishing emails to target high profile victims. These emails are
crafted with Office documents that use malicious remote templates –
whitelisted per victims – hosted on remote servers. We described one of
the techniques used by Cloud Atlas in 2017 and our colleagues at Palo
Alto Networks also wrote about it in November 2018.

Previously, Cloud Atlas dropped its “validator” implant named
“PowerShower” directly, after exploiting the Microsoft Equation
vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) mixed with CVE-2018-0802. During recent
months, we have seen a new infection chain, involving a polymorphic HTA,
a new and polymorphic VBS implant aimed at executing PowerShower, and
the Cloud Atlas second stage modular backdoor that we disclosed five
years ago in our first blogpost about them and which remains unchanged.

Let’s meet PowerShower
----------------------

PowerShower, named and previously disclosed by Palo Alto Networks in
their blogspot (see above), is a malicious piece of PowerShell designed
to receive PowerShell and VBS modules to execute on the local computer.
This malware has been used since October 2018 by Cloud Atlas as a
validator and now as a second stage. The differences in the two versions
reside mostly in anti-forensics features for the validator version of
PowerShower.

[]

The PowerShower backdoor – even in its later developments – takes three
commands:

  ------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Command            Description

  0x80 (Ascii “P”)   It is the first byte of the magic PK. The implant will save the received content as a ZIP archive under %TEMP%\PG.zip.

  0x79 (Ascii “O”)   It is the first byte of “On resume error”. The implant saves the received content as a VBS script under “%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Word\[A-Za-z]{4}.vbs” and executes it by using Wscript.exe

  Default            If the first byte doesn’t match 0x80 or 0x79, the content is saved as an XML file under “%TEMP%\temp.xml”. After that, the script loads the content of the file, parses the XML to get the PowerShell commands to execute, decodes them from Base64 and invokes IEX.  
                      After executing the commands, the script deletes “%TEMP%\temp.xml” and sends the content of “%TEMP%\pass.txt” to the C2 via an HTTP POST request.
  ------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few modules deployed by PowerShower have been seen in the wild, such
as:

-   A PowerShell document stealer module which uses 7zip (present in the
    received PG.zip) to pack and exfiltrate *.txt, *.pdf, *.xls or *.doc
    documents smaller than 5MB modified during the last two days;
-   A reconnaissance module which retrieves a list of the active
    processes, the current user and the current Windows domain.
    Interestingly, this feature is present in PowerShower but the
    condition leading to the execution of that feature is never met in
    the recent versions of PowerShower;
-   A password stealer module which uses the opensource tool LaZagne to
    retrieve passwords from the infected system.

We haven’t yet seen a VBS module dropped by this implant, but we think
that one of the VBS scripts dropped by PowerShower is a dropper of the
group’s second stage backdoor documented in our article back in 2014.

And his new friend, VBShower
----------------------------

During its recent campaigns, Cloud Atlas used a new “polymorphic”
infection chain relying no more on PowerShower directly after infection,
but executing a polymorphic HTA hosted on a remote server, which is used
to drop three different files on the local system.

-   A backdoor that we name VBShower which is polymorphic and replaces
    PowerShower as a validator;
-   A tiny launcher for VBShower ;
-   A file computed by the HTA which contains contextual data such as
    the current user, domain, computer name and a list of active
    processes.

This “polymorphic” infection chain allows the attacker to try to prevent
IoC-based defence, as each code is unique by victim so it can’t be
searched via file hash on the host.

[]

The VBShower backdoor has the same philosophy of the validator version
of PowerShower. Its aim is to complicate forensic analysis by trying to
delete all the files contained in “%APPDATA%\..\Local\Temporary Internet
Files\Content.Word” and “%APPDATA%\..\Local Settings\Temporary Internet
Files\Content.Word\”.

Once these files have been deleted and its persistence is achieved in
the registry, VBShower sends the context file computed by the HTA to the
remote server and tries to get via HTTP a VBS script to execute from the
remote server every hour.

At the time of writing, two VBS files have been seen pushed to the
target computer by VBShower. The first one is an installer for
PowerShower and the second one is an installer for the Cloud Atlas
second stage modular backdoor which communicates to a cloud storage
service via Webdav.

Final words
-----------

Cloud Atlas remains very prolific in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
The actor’s massive spear-phishing campaigns continue to use its simple
but effective methods in order to compromise its targets.

Unlike many other intrusion sets, Cloud Atlas hasn’t chosen to use open
source implants during its recent campaigns, in order to be less
discriminating. More interestingly, this intrusion set hasn’t changed
its modular backdoor, even five years after its discovery.
