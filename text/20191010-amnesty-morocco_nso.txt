Morocco: Human Rights Defenders Targeted with NSO Group’s Spyware {.h2 .heading--in-padded data-start-content=""}
=================================================================

10 October 2019, 00:01 UTC

Summary
-------

-   Amnesty International has uncovered targeted digital attacks against
    two prominent Moroccan Human Rights Defenders (HRDs) using NSO
    Group’s Pegasus spyware. According to our research, these targeted
    attacks have been ongoing since at least 2017. These were carried
    out through SMS messages carrying malicious links that, if clicked,
    would attempt to exploit the mobile device of the victim and install
    NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware.
-   In addition to SMS messages, we identified what appear to be network
    injection attacks against a HRD’s mobile network also aimed at
    installing spyware. Amnesty International suspects that the NSO
    Group may also be behind these network injection attacks.
-   These targeted digital attacks against two Moroccan HRDs are
    symptomatic of a larger pattern of reprisals against HRDs and
    dissident voices being carried out by Moroccan authorities. This is
    increasingly making it difficult for HRDs and activists to exercise
    their rights to freedom of expression and association, and peaceful
    assembly.

Introduction
------------

Amnesty International has discovered that since at least October 2017,
HRDs from Morocco have been targeted with the infamous “Pegasus“ spyware
produced by the Israeli company ‘NSO Group’. This report uncovers how
this spyware was used to unlawfully target two prominent HRDs from
Morocco, who have a history of facing reprisals from the state for
speaking out openly about human rights in the country. Amnesty
International can reveal that the two targets are Maati Monjib, an
academic and activist working on issues of freedom of expression, and
Abdessadak El Bouchattaoui, a human rights lawyer involved in the legal
defence of protestors in a social justice movement in Hirak El-Rif that
took place across 2016 and 2017.

These revelations are particularly significant in a contextwhere
Moroccan authorities are increasingly using repressive provisions from
penal codes and security laws to criminalise and discredit human rights
defenders and activists for exercising their rights to freedom of
expression, association, and peaceful assembly. Moroccan HRDs have faced
harassment, intimidation, and imprisonment. This report reveals that at
least since 2017, state authorities have also been using NSO Group’s
spyware as a tool to further shrink the space for carrying out human
rights work by targeting HRDs.  

Maati Monjib

Maati Monjib, 57, is a historian and a columnist, co-founder of the NGO
Freedom Now (dedicated to protecting the rights of journalists and
writers), and co-founder and a leading member of the Moroccan
Association for Investigative Journalism (AMJI). He is an important
voice on issues of freedom of expression in Morocco. In 2015, Moroccan
authorities accused him (and four others) of “threatening the internal
security of the state” through “propaganda” that may threaten “the
loyalty that citizens owe to the State and institutions of the Moroccan
people” under Article 206 of the Penal Code, according to official court
papers. They could be imprisoned for up to five years if found guilty.
This charge was leveled simply for promoting a mobile application for
citizen journalism that protected users’ privacy. The trial in this case
is ongoing. Previously, he had protested restrictions on his movements
by going on a hunger strike. Amnesty International is calling on the
Moroccan authorities to drop the charges against Monjib and his
co-defendants. 

Since 2015, Maati Monjib believed that he has been under digital
surveillance by Moroccan authorities. This has had a detrimental impact
on his activism and daily life. Constantly analysing what he should and
shouldn’t say in his digital communications exerted significant
psychological pressure on him.

  I need to constantly analyze the consequences of what I say and the
  risk that this may lead to defamatory accusations against me. This
  even applies to very practical things like arranging meetings or a
  dinner downtown.
  Maati Monjib, Moroccan Human Rights Defender, August 2019

Maati Monjib’s fears were proven to be true. Amnesty International met
Maati Monjib and checked his devices for traces of targeting. We found
that he was repeatedly targeted with malicious SMS messages that carried
links to websites connected to NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware.

Abdessadak El Bouchattaoui

Abdessadak El Bouchattaoui, is a lawyer and HRD. He is a part of the
legal defence team for people imprisoned for participating in the social
justice protests in the Hirak El-Rif across 2016 and 2017. In February
2017, a court in Al Hoceima sentenced him to 20 months in prison and a
fine for online posts in which he criticized the use of excessive force
by the authorities during the protests. He was charged under repressive
penal provisions that criminalise the exercise of the right to free
expression. Since the middle of 2018, he has been living in France after
his request for asylum was accepted.  Amnesty International is calling
on the Moroccan authorities to quash the conviction against him.

Since he began his work on defending protestors in Hirak, Abdessadak El
Bouchattaoui was also fairly certain that he was under surveillance by
the state. He says that he has been followed multiple times and that his
clients have also been harassed. During the course of his trial he
received death threats and his family was intimidated over the phone.
This affected his sense of psychological well-being and made it
difficult for him to carry out his work. Abdessadak El Bouchattaoui had
also long suspected that his digital communications were being
monitored. These suspicions are now definitively confirmed.

  Surveillance in Morocco is carried out in an open and brazen way…
  Surveillance is a type of punishment. You can’t behave freely. It is
  part of their strategy to make you suspect you’re being watched so you
  feel like you’re under pressure all the time.
  Abdessadak El Bouchattaoui, Moroccan Human Rights Defender, August
  2019

After checking his devices for evidence of targeting, Amnesty
International was able to confirm that Abdessadak El Bouchattaoui was
indeed targeted repeatedly with malicious SMS messages that carried
links to websites connected to NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware.

[]

[]

[]

The messages containing malicious links were sent to him during what he
recalls was the peak of the Hirak El-Rif movement and the subsequent
repression by the Moroccan security forces.

In this case, the attackers cleverly crafted the attack to appear like a
flood of automated spam SMS messages with the same text, and offering
the malicious link as a way to stop receiving them. Interestingly, some
of the malicious links started with a capital “Https://” instead of
“http://” and in one case the link missed a character, which suggests
the attackers might have been typing SMS messages manually, and then
sending them from a Moroccan number.

How do we know that NSO Group’s product is being used?
------------------------------------------------------

In June 2018 Amnesty International documented the targeting of an
Amnesty staff member and a Saudi HRD using NSO Group‘s Pegasus. SMS
messages delivered to them carried links that pointed to malicious
websites previously connected to NSO Group. SMS messages sent to
Moroccan Human Rights Defenders, as documented in this report, also
carry similar links to the same set of Internet infrastructure
attributed to NSO Group.

These messages, described as “Enhanced Social Engineering Message(s)“
(ESEM) in leaked NSO Group‘s documentation, attempt to lure victims to
click on the contained link, which would then trigger an attempt of
exploitation of the phone and the consequent silent installation of the
Pegasus spyware on the device.

Two domain names from links delivered to Maati Monjib and Abdessadek El
Bouchattaoui, stopsms[.]biz and infospress[.]com, have been previously
identified and disclosed by Amnesty International as part of NSO Group‘s
exploitation infrastructure. Additionally, we identified a new
previously unknown domain: hmizat[.]co, which seems to impersonate
Hmizate, an e-commerce company from Morocco. One message carrying a link
with this domain showed the same characteristics as typical Pegasus SMS
messages. (For a full list of all identified SMS messages, see
Appendix-II.)

(Please note: throughout this text domain names and links are escaped,
for example using “[.]” instead of dots or “hxxp” instead of “http”, in
order to avoid accidental clicks or copy & paste.)

Another domain we found in SMS messages sent to Moroccan HRDs,
revolution-news[.]co, was previously identified by Citizen Lab in the
report “Hide and Seek: Tracking NSO Group‘s Spyware to Operations in 45
Countries“ as associated to the threat actor they named “ATLAS“ and
suspected by Citizen Lab to be of Moroccan origin. 

In conclusion, because of the domain names and the characteristics of
the links sent to Maati Monjib and Abdessadek El Bouchattaoui via SMS we
can assume that, if clicked, they would have resulted in an attempted
exploitation of their devices and the subsequent infection NSO Group’s
Pegasus spyware, enabling the attackers to exercise complete monitoring
of the victims’ communications and other data.

Spyware installed through Mobile Network Injection Attacks?
-----------------------------------------------------------

While analysing the iPhone of Maati Monjib, who we confirmed above was
targeted with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware using malicious SMS links, we
observed some suspicious traces which we believe are indicative of some
peculiar exploitation attempts.

By inspecting Maati Monjib’s Safari browsing history we found visits to
suspicious links that did not originate from SMS or WhatsApp messages.

Safari records its entire browsing history in a SQLite database stored
on the device (and exportable through an iTunes backup procedure). This
database not only keeps individual records of particular links being
visited, but it also records the origin and destination of each visit.
This allows us to reconstruct redirections and the chronology of web
requests.

On July 22nd Maati Monjib opened Safari and tried to visit Yahoo by
manually typing “yahoo.fr“ in the address bar. The browser first
attempted an unencrypted connection to http://yahoo.fr.

Normally, the browser would be immediately redirected by Yahoo to its
default TLS-secured site at https://fr.yahoo.com/. Instead, the browser
history indicates that the page immediately (in less than 3
milliseconds) redirected to a very suspicious looking site:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| hxxps://bun54l2b67.get1tn0w.free247downloads[.]com:30495/szev4hz         |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This visit was followed by a redirect to the same domain, but provided
with additional arguments:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| hxxps://bun54l2b67.get1tn0w.free247downloads[.]com:30495/szev4hz#0486347 |
| 87343287485982474853012724998054718494423286                             |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This type of redirection would only be possible when the request is in
clear text, and not protected with Transport Layer Security (or TLS,
which is essentially the https:// you sometimes see in links), as was
the case with http://yahoo.fr. 

After about 30 seconds, Maati Monjib again tried to access Yahoo, this
time by searching “yahoo.fr mail“ on Google and then eventually being
directed to the right location where he then read his email.

We believe this is a symptom of a network injection attack generally
called “man-in-the-middle” attack. Through this, an attacker with
privileged access to a target’s network connection can monitor and
opportunistically hijack traffic, such as web requests. This allows them
to change the behaviour of a targeted device and, such as in this case,
to re-route it to malicious downloads or exploit pages without requiring
any extra interaction from the victim.

Such a network vantage point could be any network hop as close as
possible to the targeted device. In this case, because the targeted
device is an iPhone, connecting through a mobile line only, a potential
vantage point could be a rogue cellular tower placed in the proximity of
the target, or other core network infrastructure the mobile operator
might have been requested to reconfigure to enable this type of attack.

Because this attack is executed “invisibly” through the network instead
of with malicious SMS messages and social engineering, it has the
advantages of avoiding any user interaction and leaving virtually no
trace visible to the victim.

We believe this is what happened with Maati Monjib’s phone. As he
visited yahoo.fr, his phone was being monitored and hijacked, and Safari
was automatically directed to an exploitation server which then
attempted to silently install spyware.

[]

[]

[]

Further analysis of the device led us to identify at least four similar
injection attempts between March and July 2019. (Note: with each
attempt, the redirected URL would change slightly with different
subdomains, port number, and URI.)

[]

[]

[]

We believe at least one injection attack was successful and resulted in
the compromise of Maati Monjib’s iPhone. Additional evidence found on
the phone reinforces this suspicion.

Whenever an application crashes, iPhones store a log file keeping traces
of what precisely caused the crash. These crash logs are stored on the
phone indefinitely, at least until the phone is syncedwith iTunes. They
can be found in Settings > Privacy > Analytics > Analytics Data. Our
analysis of Maati Monjib’s phone showed that, on one occasion, all these
crash files were wiped a few seconds after one of these Safari
redirections happened. We believe it was a deliberate clean-up executed
by the spyware in order to remove traces that could lead to the
identification of the vulnerabilities actively exploited. This was
followed by the execution of a suspicious process and by a forced reboot
of the phone.

Currently, we do not have sufficient information to conclusively
attribute these suspected network injection attacks to NSO Group’s
products or services. However considering the technical similarities to
other Pegasus infections, the fact that Monjib has already been targeted
with NSO Group’s software and the fact that NSO Group advertise the
network injection capability we suspect was used in this attack, there
is reason to believe that NSO Group’s tools may also have been used in
this attack.

We confirmed Maati Monjib had already been targeted with NSO Group’s
Pegasus spyware via malicious SMS messages. The links contained in such
messages closely resemble the URLs involved in the network injection
attacks: 

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| Example of Network injection link    | Example of Pegasus SMS link          |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| hxxps://bun54l2b67.get1tn0w.free247d | hxxps://videosdownload[.]co/nBBJBIP  |
| ownloads[.]com:30495/szev4hz         |                                      |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

Both links are composed of rather generic domain names, followed by a
7-9 random alphanumeric string.

Additionally, a similar network injection capability was briefly
described in a document named "Pegasus – Product Description" –
apparently written by NSO Group – that was found in the 2015 leak of the
competing Italian spyware vendor, Hacking Team.

In this document, NSO Group refers to the vantage point as “Tactical
Network Element“, and explains how a rogue cell tower (or Base
Transceiver Station) could be used to identify the phone of the target,
and remotely inject and install Pegasus.

Why is this Wrong?
------------------

When people are targeted for surveillance based only on the exercise of
their human rights, it would amount to an “arbitrary or unlawful” attack
on their privacy and hence, would violate their freedom of expression
that is enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights. The targeting of Maati Monjib and Abdessadak El Bouchattaoui,
simply for carrying out human rights work, is unlawful according to
principles laid out in international human rights law. 

This is not the first time that spyware manufactured by the NSO Group
has been used against HRDs. In addition to it being used to target an
Amnesty staff member in 2018, NSO group’s software has also been used to
attack HRDs from Saudi Arabia, Mexico and UAE.

The NSO Group claims that the technology is only used for lawful
purposes, such as against terrorists and criminals and that if states
misuse its tools, its human rights due diligence mechanisms are
sufficient to investigate and remedy that misuse. Earlier this month,
the NSO Group also released its Human Rights Policy. In the absence of
adequate transparency on investigations of misuse by NSO Group and due
diligence mechanisms, Amnesty International has long found these claims
spurious. With the revelations detailed in this report, it has become
increasingly obvious that NSO Group’s claims and its human rights policy
are an attempt to whitewash rights violations caused by the use of its
products.

As laid out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,
the NSO Group and their primary investor, the UK-based private equity
firm Novalpina Capital, should urgently take pro-active steps to ensure
that they do not cause or contribute to human rights abuses within their
global operations, and to respond to any human rights abuses when they
do occur. In order to meet that responsibility, NSO Group must carry out
adequate human rights due diligence and take steps to ensure that HRDs
in Morocco do not continue to become targets of unlawful surveillance.

Amnesty International wrote to the NSO Group and Novalpina Capital to
seek their response on the information detailed in this report. The full
response from the NSO Group is included in Appendix-I, wherein they
reiterate that allegations of misuse would be investigated. Amnesty
International urges the NSO Group to conduct a transparent investigation
and awaits concrete action that adequately addresses the concerns raised
in this report.

Further, Moroccan authorities should disclose the details of any deals
carried out with the NSO Group and should ensure that HRDs are protected
from unlawful surveillance through adequate legal and policy safeguards
that are in line with international standards, including by providing
effective legal remedies for people to challenge violations of their
human rights linked to surveillance.

Appendix I- Response from the NSO Group
---------------------------------------

“As per our policy, we investigate reports of alleged misuse of our
products. If an investigation identifies actual or potential adverse
impacts on human rights we are proactive and quick to take the
appropriate action to address them. This may include suspending or
immediately terminating a customer’s use of the product, as we have done
in the past. 

While there are significant legal and contractual constraints concerning
our ability to comment on whether a particular government agency has
licensed our products, we are taking these allegations seriously and
will investigate this matter in keeping with our policy. Our products
are developed to help the intelligence and law enforcement community
save lives. They are not tools to surveil dissidents or human rights
activists. That’s why contracts with all of our customers enable the use
of our products solely for the legitimate purposes of preventing and
investigating crime and terrorism. If we ever discover that our products
were misused in breach of such a contract, we will take appropriate
action.”
