Malware-analysis

Initial vector

Use a document with a remote template injection as initial vector. This
request http[:]//maq.com.pk/ for be redirected on the next URL.

[alt text]

This seconds URL (http[:]//maq.com.pk/wehsd) send an RTF exploit.

[alt text]

This exploit firstly executes a request by WebDAV and after by WebClient
service for download the backdoor on the final address
(http[:]//maq.com.pk/wehs) and execute it.

[alt text]

Here we can see the redirection and the data sended on the victim.

[alt text]

ArtraDownloader

In the first, we can see that launch by the factory option for separate
the application of the current Explorer instance for avoid if one
crashes the other stays alive (C:\Windows\explorer.exe
/factory,{75dff2b7-6936-4c06-a8bb-676a7b00b24b} -Embedding). Secondly,
we can note encoded string pushed on a function and the result is moved
on another registry as storage for be used by the backdoor.

[alt text]

In observing this function we can resume by the following algorithm used
for decode these strings : for each byte of the string -> value of the
byte -1 -> get Unicode value -> convert to char.

[alt text]

We can edit a script for decode the encoded string.

[alt text]

Now we can see the actions did by the malware.

[alt text] [alt text]

Once this done, we can see on the entry point, this uses the startupinfo
structure to specify window properties, verify the header of the PE and
the get the environment values for create the process. The malware is
coded in C++ language.

[alt text]

We can observe that the malware pushes the persistence by a Run key in
the registry. We can note too that use DOS commands with an environment
value ("C:\ProgramData\Ntuser\winlgn.exe") for launch the backdoor.

[alt text]

This query the registry for getting, the version of the OS and proceeds
for identifying the victim’s machine GUID by the
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\MachineGuid registry key.

[alt text]

This use too, the EncodePointer function for encoding a specified
pointer (encoded pointers can be used to provide another layer of
protection for pointer values).

[alt text]

After performing the reconnaissance actions, this can send a query as
pulse with the informations to the C2, the URL to send is decoded and an
additional operation give the final URL.

[alt text] [alt text]

The data are encoded by the algorithm too, with the script, we can
decode the strings and see that the roles and data send to the C2.

SNI=VTFS.QD&UME=Xjoepxt!8!Qspgfttjpobm&OPQ=benjo&IVR=VTFS.QD$$benjoAA11482.572.3314613.96675&st=0
(Here from the Anyrun sandbox)

We can resume all the variables used and the type of the informations
sent in the C2.

  Variable   Description
  ---------- -----------------------------------------
  SNI        Computer name
  UME        OS Version
  OPQ        Account name
  IVR        [Computer name]##[Account name]@@[GUID]
  st         downloaded file executed successfully ?

Cyber kill chain

This process graph represents the cyber kill chain of Bitter sample.

Cyber Threat Intel

Since the last 2 weeks, the C2 domain have changed (.193 to .198) due to
this are on the same subnet of the Verdina organization (Bulgaria cloud
provider).

[alt text]

We can note on the WHOIS information that this registered in Ras
al-khaimah location.

[alt text]

The location is placed in the business place of the city.

[alt text]

We can note that two phone numbers with the country indicate (Indian and
Iranian) have the same address for two companies.

[alt text] [alt text]

In Ras al-Khaimah, there is no corporate tax, no profits, no customs
duties, no inheritance tax, it is not excluding that the group Bitter
chose this place as a tax haven for their operations.
