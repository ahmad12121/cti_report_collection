APT reports

Zebrocy’s Multilanguage Malware Salad {.entry-title}
=====================================

By GReAT on June 3, 2019. 2:00 pm

Zebrocy is Russian speaking APT that presents a strange set of stripes.
To keep things simple, there are three things to know about Zebrocy

Zebrocy is an active sub-group of victim profiling and access
specialists

Zebrocy maintains a lineage back through 2013, sharing malware artefacts
and similarities with BlackEnergy

The past five years of Zebrocy infrastructure, malware set, and
targeting have similarities and overlaps with both the Sofacy and []

Zebrocy shares data points and crosses lines with other clusters of
activity in unique and unexpected ways. Zebrocy initially shared limited
infrastructure, targets, and interests with Sofacy. Zebrocy also shared
malware code with past BlackEnergy/Sandworm; and targeting, and later
very limited infrastructure with more recent BlackEnergy/GreyEnergy.
Oddly, Turla deployed spearphish macros almost identical to previous,
non-public Zebrocy code in 2018.

It’s fantastic to see some of these same points being repeated publicly
by other research teams. A previous claim that Zebrocy distributed
Sofacy’s XAgent as a second stage implant remains unsubstantiated but
now is replaced with findings identical to these following the SAS2019
presentation, so it seems we are all slowly getting on the same page.

A first course with new additions
---------------------------------

When we originally documented a Zebrocy malware incident in late 2015,
we noted an Oct 2015 AutoIT downloader and a Delphi backdoor payload.
Since then, we have noted a virtual salad of Zebrocy code tossed
together, built with a handful of languages, often ripped from various
code sharing sites. Zebrocy activity initiates with spearphishing
operations delivering various target profilers and downloaders without
the use of any 0day exploits. Browser credential theft, keylogging, and
Windows credential theft, along with some incidents of file and
communications theft, are all on the list of Zebrocy second stage
implant specials.

This Zebrocy dish is served before the main course – gaining and
maintaining access is not an easy job. And, because the group seems to
maintain lineage in both the 0day capable and destructive
BlackEnergy/Sandworm APT and the prolific and 0day capable Sofacy APT,
this course is very interesting. Let’s take a more intelligent
perspective on the Zebrocy malware set and activity and its lineage,
based on reporting provided to our []

Since the SAS2019 presentation, we have identified a new Zebrocy
backdoor family, deployed with a new downloader. So Zebrocy continues to
expand its malware set. There appears to be both a return to C coding
for the group, and also an expansion with the []

A set of Zebrocy related events best characterize years of the activity
and help to carve out the group’s own profile, its lineage, malware set,
infrastructure, and modus operandi.

Zebrocy lineage – early Sofacy infrastructure overlap (late 2015/early
2016) for the Zebrocy Delphi backdoor

Zebrocy lineage – Delphocy Delphi deployment and abrupt conclusion (2013
– late 2015), and start of Zebrocy Delphi timeline (late 2015)

Zebrocy lineage – shared, unique kernel code between BlackEnergy and
Delphocy bootkit (2013 – 2015)

Zebrocy unique malware set – vintage Delphi programming coupled with
unusual and agile development capabilities with new managed languages
like Python, C#, and Go all perform screengrab anchor, volume serial
number id, systeminfo and process list collection

Zebrocy ongoing targeting and infrastructure overlap – fairly recent []

-   The full 2018 decline of SPLM/XAgent for the more traditional
    “Sofacy” activity
-   A coincidental new increase in Zebrocy activity
-   Shared build-id format with BlackEnergy modules
-   An expansion in Zebrocy spearphishing
-   An expansion in the managed languages the Zebrocy malware set is
    built on

[]

These predictions later turned into global events, as lighter targeting
turned into a massive global surge of Zebrocy activity, sometimes
sharing targets between both Sofacy and Zebrocy. Also later that year,
the Zebrocy malware set expanded with C#, Python, and Go. This wouldn’t
be the first or last time we reported on this group’s innovative malware
set.

Zebrocy Delphi backdoor shared artefacts rooted in Delphocy and BlackEnergy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The limited set of 2013-2015 Delphocy intrusions in Ukraine and Poland
deployed a Delphi backdoor both with and without a bootkit loader. This
bootkit loader included a routine that shares the same compiled code
with only the BlackEnergy kernel loaders, helping to tie Zebrocy malware
to the BlackEnergy malware set.

This unique encryption implementation was shared between BlackEnergy’s
kernel loader, and Delphocy’s bootkit kernel loader code. The appearance
of this code overlap coincides with several project events:

-   End of Delphocy/BlackEnergy overlapped code use, while BlackEnergy
    moved forward with other code
-   End of Delphocy’s user-mode Delphi payload (October 2015)
-   Start of Zebrocy’s Delphi payload (October 2015)

A particular chunk of kernel mode code for a custom encryption routine
was shared across the older Delphocy bookit and the BlackEnergy malware
platform in 2013. While Delphocy replaced this bootkit with a simplified
user-mode persistence technique, BlackEnergy malware continued using
this code until late 2015. Then, these APTs discontinued both the
Delphi-based Delphocy project and the use of this mysterious chunk of
code within BlackEnergy malware. Almost immediately, Delphi-based
Zebrocy backdoors began to be deployed. Several months later, a Zebrocy
backdoor connected back to a domain that was registered by a particular
email address. This address had been used to register another Sofacy
domain hosted on a well-known Sofacy IP at the time
(rammatica[.]com/raveston[.]com).

[]

Note that both Delphocy’s and BlackEnergy’s kernel mode code
appropriated unique content in 2013 from the Carberp codebase – hashing,
injection, bootkit functionality. Surprisingly, this same unique
encryption cipher was seen pasted again into 2018 VPNFilter code as
well. Clearly it happens with other malware, but Zebrocy’s consistent
copy/paste tendency is something not frequently seen in other APT
malware with a “best use” date spanning five years or more. Portions of
its AutoIT code were copied from code sharing forums and pasted into
their own code. This is different from Sofacy’s disappeared and
exhaustive SPLM/XAgent codebase. It was used for at least six years and
was entirely custom-built.

Zebrocy’s mix
-------------

The Zebrocy malware set is tossed together from a wide set of languages
and technologies, including both legitimate and malicious code shared on
online forums and sites like Github and Pastebin. This repeated
“copy/paste” practice is not frequently seen in Russian speaking APT
malware sets, although []

C# Zebrocy backdoor

Zebrocy pushed a C# backdoor that maintains much the same functionality
as its other assortment of backdoor implementations.

[]

Most interesting in this implementation is its consistent collection of
screengrab and system information, and a list of running processes.
Again, with this first stage backdoor, it is profiling its targets and
looking for unexpected sources of credential collection to develop
bespoke second stage credential harvesters against. Additionally,
Zebrocy wheeled out a []

A second stage
--------------

These findings were particularly interesting in the light of past claims
about SPLM/XAgent being the second stage of choice for Zebrocy, for
which there was a lot of monitoring on our part, but never any data
support. Some guesses were made about why that was, perhaps Zebrocy
downloaders were all mitigated prior to attempting to download further
stages? But never any answers.

Instead, we arrived at the answers ourselves. In order to account for
unexpected software installations at victim systems, no matter which
language, each first stage backdoor implementation collects a “system
information” listing, screengrab, and enumerates running processes. This
malware behavior was included in Zebrocy backdoors from the very first
backdoor that we reported on, and continued into 2019 with the latest
rounds of Go backdoors. After collected information is POSTed to the C2,
a long delay ensues. Eventually, target systems may receive a custom
built second stage implant to retrieve credentials from those unexpected
software sources. More unusual software packages included little-known
customized Chromium builds like CentBrowser and 7Star from Asian
studios. In some cases, malware password stealers are deployed to
address more common software.

[]

In addition, Zebrocy file content stealers and keyloggers coded in C#
were detected at targets in 2017 and 2018. Some of this code and their
build id value format was reviewed in the SAS2018 “Masha and these
Bears” presentation.

Served cold
-----------

Zebrocy version 2.2 called back to a domain sharing Whois and hosting
resources with Sofacy in early 2016, and later versions used naming and
URL constructs very similar to BlackEnergy resources. And since then,
just like BlackEnergy, mostly all of the Zebrocy C2 used no domain
registrations. Communications directly to the host over IPv4 with no
domain resolution are common behavior for the group’s malware. However,
every now and then, Zebrocy malware calls back to servers located by
hardcoded domain names.

Its ongoing activity demonstrates a long game commitment to gaining
access to targeted networks. And as we predicted at SAS2018 and SAS2019,
this latest new Nim coding adds to the growing list of languages for
this malware set. We will see more from Zebrocy into 2019 on government
and military related organizations.
