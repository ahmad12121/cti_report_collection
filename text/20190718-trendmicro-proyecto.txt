We observed a recent campaign that primarily targets financial
institutions and governmental organizations in the South American
region, particularly in Colombia. This blog post covers the activities
we observed, the remote access tools (RATs) used, the campaign’s
techniques and procedures, and its indicators of compromise (IoCs). Our
findings indicate that the campaign appears to be the work of a group
involved in business email compromise (BEC) or cybercrime, and unlikely
to be an advanced persistent threat (APT).

It’s worth noting that the group uses YOPmail, a disposable email
address service, for its command and control server (C&C). The payload,
written in Visual Basic 6, is a customized version of a remote access
tool called “Proyecto RAT.” Our in-depth analysis of the malware is
detailed in this appendix.

The delivery emails

The infection starts with an email sent to a target, as seen in the
screenshot below (Figure 1). In multiple instances, we noticed the
attacker used open or compromised mail servers in South America to
facilitate the campaigns. The attacker also connected to the compromised
servers from IP addresses that were linked to dynamic domain names used
as C&Cs by the delivered payloads. This suggests that the attacker uses
the same infrastructure to send emails and control victims.

The sender of the email is usually spoofed, and we saw multiple email
subjects enticing the receiver to open the attachment, which is an RTF
file. Examples of such subjects are:

-   “Hemos iniciado un proceso en su contra por violencia laboral.”
    (Loosely translates to “We have filed a lawsuit against you for
    workplace violence.”)
-   “Se hara efectivo un embargo a su(s) cuenta(s) Bancarias.” (Loosely
    translates to “Your banking accounts are going to be blocked.”)
-   “Almacenes exito te obsequia una tarjeta regalo virtual por valor de
    $500.000.” (Loosely translates to “Exito shops offer you a virtual
    gift worth $500.000.”)

[Figure 1. Delivery email]

Figure 1. Delivery email

The attached RTF file contains one line of text and a link. The text
relates to the email subject, such as “You can see the complaint against
you below.” or “See the complaint online.” Note that the link to the
malware uses the URL shortener cort.as, which belongs to the El País
newspaper. Unfortunately, this service only enables statistics on
demand, and the attacker never enabled them.

Clicking on the link redirects the victim to a file on a file-sharing
service. The file is a delivery document that contains macros.

The delivery documents

The majority of the documents we analyzed were in MHTML format, which
contains macros. The macro code is a simple downloader for the payload.
However, Office files in OLE format were also observed. Most of the
document designs have already been published in Qihoo360’s blog post;
this post will discuss designs that the post did not cover. The
documents, which appeared between 2017 and 2019, all asked users to
enable macros. The macros will download and execute a RAT.

First stage payload: Remote Access Tool (RAT)

The main payload is usually Imminent Monitor RAT; however, at the
beginning of 2018, we also observed the use of LuminosityLink RAT,
NetWire RAT, and NjRAT. In a case in June 2019, we also noticed Warzone
RAT being used. Warzone RAT is the newer RAT from the list and supports
keylogger, web browser-, and Outlook password-stealing features in
addition to standard RAT functions.

All of these RATs are standard malware that can be bought for under
US$100 or downloaded from various malware repositories.

After the download of Imminent Monitor RAT and observing its network
behavior, we noticed an instruction to download and execute another
executable file, which is the second stage payload.

[Figure 8. Imminent Monitor RAT traffic]

Second stage payload: Proyecto RAT

The second stage payload is written in Visual Basic 6, and has an
interesting feature — a C&C URL address acquired from the disposable
email service YOPmail. The malware connects to a mailbox, reads the only
available email message, parses it, and then extracts the subject of the
email. The C&C server URL is between the ‘¡’ characters (upside-down
exclamation sign), a character used in the Spanish language. This is the
first time we noticed disposable email services being abused this way.

[Figure 9. A disposable email with C&C address and email subject]

Figure 9. A disposable email with C&C address and email subject

During our analysis, we found three mailboxes related to the malware. We
have since reached out to YOPmail and informed them of this threat.
YOPmail has responded, saying that they would place specific
restrictions.

A detailed technical analysis of the classes, forms, and modules
revealed when the malware is decompiled can be found in this appendix.

Searching for the malware family

Seeing the many features of the malware, we tried to match it to a known
RAT.

The communication between client and server is via TCP, is unencrypted,
and uses pipe “|” characters and “¡@#@!” as a separator. This
description fits quite well with Xpert RAT. Searching for the x86 hex
string from cTimer class also leads to links with Xpert RAT. This tweet
from a malware researcher even mentions Xpert RAT.

An online search found two versions of Xpert RAT were found: “XpertRAT
v3.0.10 By Abronsius” and “XpertRAT v3.0.9 By Abronsius”. After building
the payload and infecting the test machine, we could observe the
communication in figure 10. Notice the different colors between the
incoming and outgoing communication and the separator between both
communication streams. However, in Xpert RAT builder, we did not notice
any reference to a disposable email, searches for banking website
captions, or information written to the configuration file. In addition,
Xpert RAT samples generated by the builder have even more functions such
as keylogger, runPE, WebCam, Audio, Wipe module, and Remote Desktop.

[Figure 10. Original Xpert RAT communication snippet]

It seems that the aforementioned Visual Basic malware is an old and
limited version of the Xpert RAT — either a custom modification of Xpert
RAT or a malware with source code based on Xpert RAT’s.

When searching for class names from the Visual Basic malware, the
keyword “ClsRemoteRegistry” leads to a discussion on a Spanish hacking
forum (Figure 13). The user, who in his profile offers Prodigy Bot, an
IRC bot written in VB6, has a question related to the code from Leandro
Ascierto’s project called “Proyecto RAT.”

[Figure 13. Discussion about ClsRemoteRegisty class on a hacking forum]

After downloading and examining the project, we noticed familiar class
names, delimiters, strings, and more.

[Figure 17. Hex code from cTimer class, with original comments in

Based on these details, we believe this is a customized version of
Proyecto RAT.

Affected regions and verticals

Colombia is by far the most targeted country, with other South American
countries added to the list. This is consistent with the fact that this
actor uses the Spanish language in all the spear phishing documents we
observed. However, we also noticed targets in other countries:

[Figure 18. The regions targeted by the spear-phishing documents]

Figure 18. The regions targeted by the spear-phishing documents

In one instance, the attacker used the URL shortener bit.ly, which
confirmed that Colombia is the main target. As anyone can follow the
link, some of these countries could also be the result of researchers’
sandboxes.

[Figure 19. Clicks and locations related to the bit.ly link]

Figure 19. Clicks and locations related to the bit.ly link

Recent campaigns targeted different industries. The most prevalent were
government entities, healthcare/pharmaceutical institutions, followed by
financial/banking/insurance and agro-industry/food/packaging
organizations.

Notably, we noticed that multiple employee savings funds (called “Fondo
de empleados” in Colombia) were targeted. These entities barely have
access to sensitive information, but they are likely to possess a
reasonable amount of money.

Conclusion and mitigation

Xpert RAT reportedly first appeared in 2011. The first version of
“Proyecto RAT” was published at the end of 2010. Both projects share
similarities, and it is likely that “Proyecto RAT” was inspiration for
Xpert RAT and at least a few more malware projects, including the Visual
Basic malware in the campaign we previously described.

We can’t say for sure what this actor is particularly looking for, but
multiple facts lead us to believe it is designed for BEC or cybercrime
rather than as an APT:

-   These campaigns are noisier and more prevalent than usual APT
    campaigns.
-   The same IP address, which is dynamic, is used to send
    spear-phishing emails and act as C&C. This is more common to
    cybercrime.
-   Some of the targeted industries might not have access to sensitive
    information, but are likely to handle a decent amount of money.
-   The windows titles that are listed in the configuration file are
    almost all related to financial services.

Our research shows that this campaign can deliver malware with multiple
capabilities that can affect different organizations and industries. It
also highlights the importance of securing online infrastructures,
particularly the email gateways, to avoid targeted spam campaigns.
Organizations should adopt best practices on messaging-related threats
and regularly update systems to prevent attackers from taking advantage
of any security gaps. Employing additional security mechanisms such as
enabling firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention systems will
help prevent suspicious network activities that may lead to data
exfiltration or C&C communication.
