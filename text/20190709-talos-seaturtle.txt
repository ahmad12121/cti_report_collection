Sea Turtle keeps on swimming, finds new victims, DNS hijacking techniques

[]

  
   
 By Danny Adamitis with contributions from Paul Rascagneres.  
   

Executive summary

After several months of activity, the actors behind the "Sea Turtle" DNS
hijacking campaign are not slowing down. Cisco Talos recently discovered
new details that suggest they regrouped after we published our initial
findings and coverage and are redoubling their efforts with new
infrastructure. While many actors will slow down once they are
discovered, this group appears to be unusually brazen, and will be
unlikely to be deterred going forward.  
   
 Additionally, we discovered a new DNS hijacking technique that we
assess with moderate confidence is connected to the actors behind Sea
Turtle. This new technique is similar in that the threat actors
compromise the name server records and respond to DNS requests with
falsified A records. This new technique has only been observed in a few
highly targeted operations. We also identified a new wave of victims,
including a country code top-level domain (ccTLD) registry, which
manages the DNS records for every domain uses that particular country
code, that access was used to then compromise additional government
entities. Unfortunately, unless there are significant changes made to
better secure DNS, these sorts of attacks are going to remain
prevalent.  
   
   

New DNS hijacking technique

Talos now has moderate confidence that the threat actors behind Sea
Turtle have been using another DNS hijacking technique. This new
technique has been used very sparingly, and thus far have only
identified two entities that were targeted in 2018, though we believe
there are likely more.  
   
 This new technique once again involved modifying the target domain's
name server records to point legitimate users to the actor-controlled
server. In this case, the actor-controlled name server and the hijacked
hostnames would both resolve to the same IP address for a short period
of time, typically less than 24 hours. In both observed cases, one of
the hijacked hostnames would reference an email service and the threat
actors would presumably harvest user credentials. One aspect of this
technique that makes it extremely difficult to track is that the
actor-controlled name servers were not used across multiple targets —
meaning that every entity hijacked with this technique had its own
dedicated name server hostname and its own dedicated IP address. Whereas
previously reported name server domains such as ns1[.]intersecdns[.]com
were used to target multiple organizations.   
   
 In one case, a private organization primarily used a third-party
service as their authoritative name server. Then, for a three-hour
window in January 2018, their name server records were changed to a name
server hostname that mimicked a slightly different version of the
organization's name. During that three-hour window, the actor-controlled
IP address hosted three hostnames, the two actor-controlled name servers
and the webmail hostname. This would allow the threat actors to perform
a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, as outlined in our previous post, and
harvest credentials. This technique was also observed against a
government organizations in the Middle East and North African region.   
   

Continued activity against ccTLD

The Institute of Computer Science of the Foundation for Research and
Technology - Hellas (ICS-Forth), the ccTLD for Greece, acknowledged on
its public website that its network had been compromised on April 19,
2019. Based on Cisco telemetry, we determined that the actors behind the
Sea Turtle campaign had access to the ICS-Forth network.  
   
 Cisco telemetry confirmed that the actors behind Sea Turtle maintained
access to the ICS-Forth network from an operational command and control
(C2) node. Our telemetry indicates that the actors maintained access in
the ICS-Forth network through at least April 24, five days after the
statement was publicly released. Upon analysis of this operational C2
node, we determined that it was also used to access an organization in
Syria that was previously redirected using the actor-controlled name
server ns1[.]intersecdns[.]com. This indicates that the same threat
actors were behind both operations.   
   
 We also saw evidence that the threat actors researched the open-source
tool PHP-Proxy. Notably, this particular C2 node searched for both
blog.talosintelligence.com and ncsc.gov.uk, presumably to view Talos'
previous reports on DNS hijacking and this DNS hijacking advisory from
the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre.  
   

New actor-controlled nameserver

We recently discovered a new actor-controlled nameserver,
rootdnservers[.]com, that exhibited similar behavior patterns as name
servers previously utilized as part of the Sea Turtle campaign. The
domain rootdnservers[.]com was registered on April 5, 2019 through the
registrar NameCheap. The new actor-controlled name server
rootdnservers[.]com was utilized to perform DNS hijacking against three
government entities that all used .gr, the Greek ccTLD. It's likely that
these hijackings were performed through the access the threat actors
obtained in the ICS-Forth network. Below is a table showing the three
most recent actor-controlled name servers that we have associated with
this activity and their current operational status.  
   

  ---------------------------- ---------------------- --------------------
  Hostnames                    IP addresses           Operational Status
  ns1[.]rootdnservers[.]com.   45[.]32[.]100[.]62     Active
  ns2[.]rootdnservers[.]com.   45[.]32[.]100[.]62     Active
  ns1[.]intersecdns[.]com      95[.]179[.]150[.]101   Inactive
  ns2[.]intersecdns[.]com      95[.]179[.]150[.]101   Inactive
  ---------------------------- ---------------------- --------------------

  

New IP addresses associated with man-in-the-middle activity

By identifying the targeted domains, we were able to identify the
hijacked hostnames and the corresponding actor-controlled MitM nodes.
The threat actors, again employing previously documented tradecraft, by
performing a "certificate impersonation" technique. This is where the
threat actors procure an SSL certificate for the targeted hostname from
a different SSL provider. Below is a table showing the dates and
associated IP addresses.  
   

  ---------------- ----------------------
  Date             IP address
  April 13, 2019   95[.]179[.]131[.]225
  April 16, 2019   95[.]179[.]131[.]225
  April 11, 2019   95[.]179[.]131[.]225
  April 11, 2019   140[.]82[.]58[.]253
  April 10, 2019   95[.]179[.]156[.]61

Updated victimology

[]

  
 Since our initial report, Sea Turtle has continued to compromise a
number of different entities to fulfill their requirements. We have
identified some of the new primary targets as:  

-   Government organizations
-   Energy companies
-   Think tanks
-   International non-governmental organizations
-   At least one airport

In terms of secondary targets, we have seen very similar targets as
those previously reported, such as telecommunications providers,
internet service providers and one registry.  
   

Coverage and mitigations

In order to best protect against this type of attack, we compiled a list
of potential actions. We have included additional security
recommendations, that were highlighted by Bill Woodcock during his
presentations on DNS/IMAP attacks.  

-   We recommend implementing multi-factor authentication, such as DUO,
    to secure the management of your organization's DNS records at your
    registrar, and to connect remotely to your corporate network via a
    Virtual Private Network (VPN).
-   Talos suggests a registry lock service on your domain names, which
    will require the registrar to provide an out-of-band confirmation
    before the registry will process any changes to an organization's
    DNS record.
-   DNSSEC sign your domains, either in-house, or using a DNS service
    provider which performs DNSSEC key-management services.
-   DNSSEC validate all DNS lookups in your recursive resolver, either
    using in-house nameservers, or a service like Cisco Umbrella /
    OpenDNS.
-   Make Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) email servers
    accessible only from your corporate LAN and to users who have
    already authenticated over a VPN.
-   If you suspect you were targeted by this type of activity, we
    recommend instituting a network-wide password reset, preferably from
    a computer on a trusted network.
-   Lastly, network administrators can monitor passive DNS record on
    their domains, to check for abnormalities.
