[FakeNarrator Malware]

Chinese APT hackers launching a FakeNarrator malware to attack
technology companies using windows computers and implant modified
version of open-source PcShare backdoor.

Threat actors loaded this open-source software in victims machine with
the help of legitimate NVIDIA application and also deploy the
FakeNarrator screen reader application to replace the Windows built-in
Narrator, a free screen reader in Microsoft Windows nad bypass the
Windows “Easy access” feature.

The malware campaign mainly targeting the tech companies that located in
south-east Asia successful attack could allow attackers to gain complete
control of the targetted system and take the remote desktop access
without any sort of credentials.

Attackers customize the Chinese based opensource backdoor PcShare for
their operation and used the backdoor as the main foothold on the
victim’s machine.

They included various features in the backdoor including
command-and-control (C&C) encryption and proxy bypass functionality and
they’re removed some of the unused functionality which they feel not
necessary for this campaign.

PcShare Backdoor Infection Process
----------------------------------

Once the attacker gains access to the victim’s machine, they start
deploying the post-exploitation tools which have been developed with the
help of publicly available source code that can be accessed via the
Chinese programming portal.

Threat actors use one of the post-exploitation toolcalled bespoke Trojan
to abusing the Microsoft Accessibility Features to gain SYSTEM-level
access on the compromised machine.

Here the FakeNarrator comes into play, attacker Trojanize the Narrator
executable to gain the SYSTEM-level access and maintain the persistence.

According to cylance research” The campaign is characterized by a fair
level of stealthiness as the threat actor made a concerted effort to
avoid detection. The use of DLL side-loading technique together with a
bespoke loader utilizing memory injection ensures that the main backdoor
binary is never dropped to the disk.”

Loader overview

Also, the malware using an anti-sandbox technique to evade the detection
by antivirus solutions and protected its command and control server
communication.

Researchers also find the PcShare backdoor similarities with Tropic
Trooper which is actively targeting government institutions and heavy
industry companies in Taiwan and the Philippines.

The backdoor is capable of performing some of following remote
administration abilities:

-   List, create, rename, delete files and directories
-   List and kill processes
-   Edit registry keys and values
-   List and manipulate services
-   Enumerate and control windows
-   Execute binaries
-   Download additional files from the C&C or provided URL
-   Upload files to the C&C
-   Spawn command-line shell
-   Navigate to URLs
-   Display message boxes
-   Reboot or shut down the system

“Once the FakeNarrator is enabled at the logon screen via “Ease of
Access”, the malware will be executed by winlogon.exe with SYSTEM
privileges. Typing the attacker’s defined password will allow the
attacker to spawn any executable, also running under the SYSTEM account,
at the logon screen” Cylance researchers said.

Its leads to gain the persistence shell on the compromised windows
machine without having the valid credentials.
