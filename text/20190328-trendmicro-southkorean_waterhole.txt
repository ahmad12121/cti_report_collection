Desktop, Mobile Phishing Campaign Targets South Korean Websites, Steals Credentials Via Watering Hole

We discovered a phishing campaign that has compromised at least four
South Korean websites – including a business page ranked as one of the
most visited sites in the country – by injecting fake login forms to
steal user credentials. While we’ve previously seen cybercriminals
inject a malicious JavaScript code in the websites to load browser
exploits or financial information skimmers, using the watering hole
technique for a phishing campaign is unusual. The campaign, which we
labeled “Soula” (detected by Trend Micro as Trojan.HTML.PHISH.TIAOOHDW),
collects information via a spoofed login screen of one of the country’s
leading search engines that pops up over the original webpage. It sends
the logged credentials to the attackers’ server even without accurate
data confirmation, leading us to think that the cybercriminals are at
research and information-gathering stage.

Routine

[]

Figure 1. Soula’s attack chain.

We traced the initial JavaScript injection done on the compromised
websites on March 14. The injected script profiles the website’s
visitors and loads the phishing forms on top of the main pages. It scans
the HTTP referer header string and checks if it contains keywords
related to popular search engines and social media sites to authenticate
that the visitor is real. Since the HTTP referer identifies the address
webpage of the source to the requested page, this check makes it easier
to identify the visitor as a real user if the request comes from one, as
well as filter out bot crawlers or threat engine scanners.

The script then scans for the HTTP User-Agent header for strings such as
iPhone, iPad, iPod, iOS and Android to identify the device used by the
user as desktop or mobile, which allows it to deliver the respective
phishing forms to the victim.  Mobile users will see the fake login form
pop-up only after clicking any button on the compromised websites. To
mask the malicious routine, it only enables the pop-up to appear after
the sixth time the victim visits the websites, setting a cookie to count
the number of visits. The cookie is also set to expire after two hours
since the last pop-up.

Figure 2. Injected script to check HTTP Referer and HTTP User-Agent.

If the device has none of the strings listed, Soula assumes that the
user is visiting the website using a desktop computer. Users will see
the fake login form directly on top of the compromised webpage, asking
the user to input their username and password before they can continue
visiting the site. The user information is directly sent to the
attackers’ servers. To prevent attack suspicions from the website, the
phishing script sets a browser cookie to the devices that received the
phishing forms that enables the fake login to expire 12 hours after the
initial interaction.

We noted that the comments were set in Simplified Chinese, and used
Cloudflare to protect their domains and hide their real IP addresses. We
contacted Cloudflare after identifying this attack, but while they
immediately removed the malicious domain from their service, the
campaign did not stop. In fact, the campaign further enhanced its
detection evasion features. The attackers added obfuscation to the
JavaScript code injected into the compromised websites and moved the
scripts and phishing page to a compromised web server to avoid detection
and prevent removal of their domain. The websites are no longer
compromised at the time of publishing.

Conclusion

Considering that one of the compromised websites are among the country’s
top 300 most-visited sites, and that the search engine hosts a variety
of services for its South Korean customers as a trusted site, Soula is a
significant threat to both enterprises and users as it exposes user
credentials on a number of platforms. Further, the content string it
searches for and connects to may indicate cybercriminals’ possible plans
to develop this to a bigger campaign that could affect more people
worldwide.

While this technique can be more difficult to trace compared to socially
engineered phishing attacks, endpoint users can still protect themselves
by enabling a multi-layered defense system that allows detection,
scanning and blocking of malicious URLs and pop-ups. Users should also
enable additional authentication measures such as 2FA whenever possible.
Security administrators are advised to download updates as soon as
patches are available from legitimate vendors, and enable Content
Security Policy to prevent unauthorized access and use of exploits for
remotely injected scripts.

Business Process Compromise

-   Attackers are starting to invest in long-term operations that target
    specific processes enterprises rely on. They scout for vulnerable
    practices, susceptible systems and operational loopholes that they
    can leverage or abuse. To learn more, read our Security 101:
