SWEED: Exposing years of Agent Tesla campaigns

[]

By Edmund Brumaghin and other Cisco Talos researchers.  
   

Executive summary {#h.4678d0m5g74l}
-----------------

  
 Cisco Talos recently identified a large number of ongoing malware
distribution campaigns linked to a threat actor we're calling "SWEED,"
including such notable malware as Formbook, Lokibot and Agent Tesla.
Based on our research, SWEED — which has been operating since at least
2017 — primarily targets their victims with stealers and remote access
trojans.  
   
 SWEED remains consistent across most of their campaigns in their use of
spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments. While these campaigns
have featured a myriad of different types of malicious documents, the
actor primarily tries to infect its victims with a packed version of
Agent Tesla — an information stealer that's been around since at least
2014. The version of Agent Tesla that SWEED is using differs slightly
from what we've seen in the past in the way that it is packed, as well
as how it infects the system. In this post, we'll run down each campaign
we're able to connect to SWEED, and talk about some of the actor's
tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).  
   

2017: Steganography {#h.v1241jkvqqcf}
-------------------

  
 One of the earliest SWEED campaigns Talos identified dates back to
2017. In this attack, the actors placed droppers inside of ZIP archives,
and then attached those ZIPs to emails. The attachments usually had file
names similar to "Java_Updater.zip" or "P-O of Jun2017.zip". Here's an
example of an email associated with this campaign:  

[]

The attached ZIP archive contained a packed version of Agent Tesla. The
packer uses .NET and leverages steganography to hide and decode a second
.NET executable, which uses the same technique to retrieve the final
Agent Tesla payload. Here's the file stored in the resource:  

[]

And here's the algorithm used to decode the PE stored in that image:  

[]

The decoded binary is stored in the array.  
   

January 2018: Java droppers {#h.6p9k47y0vjuw}
---------------------------

  
 In early 2018, we observed that SWEED began leveraging Java-based
droppers. Similar to previous campaigns, the JAR was directly attached
to emails and used file names such as "Order_2018.jar". The purpose of
the JAR was to obtain information about the infected system and
facilitate the download of a packed version of Agent Tesla.
Interestingly, only a few months prior to these campaigns, a HackForums
user with the account name "Sweed" actively sought out a Java crypter —
but we'll get to that activity later.  
   

April 2018: Office exploit (CVE-2017-8759) {#h.es8o2e2u96k}
------------------------------------------

  
 In April 2018, SWEED began making use of a previously disclosed Office
exploit. One of the documents featured in these email campaigns was
notable because it was a PowerPoint document (PPXS). Code contained
inside one of the slides triggers an exploit for CVE-2017-8759, a remote
code execution vulnerability in Microsoft .NET framework.  

[]

You can see the execution of external content hosted on the
attacker-controlled web server using the file name "chuks.png". As
expected, the PNG is not actually an image. Instead, it is a Soap
definition in XML, as seen in the screenshot below:  

[]

The purpose of this code is to decode a URL and download a PE32 hosted
on an attacker-controlled web server. The resulting executable is a
packed version of Agent Tesla.  
   

May 2018: Office exploit (CVE-2017-11882) {#h.evivk99zx181}
-----------------------------------------

  
 In May 2018, campaigns being conducted by SWEED began leveraging
another vulnerability in Microsoft Office: CVE-2017-11882, a remote code
execution bug in Microsoft Office that is commonly observed being
leveraged in malicious documents used in commodity malware distribution.
  
   
 We see how the vulnerability abuses the Equation Editor in Office when
executing the sample in ThreatGrid:  

[]

As seen below, the malicious document is designed to appear as if it is
an invoice.  

[]

As consistent with previous campaigns, the purpose of this malicious
document is to download and execute a packed version of Agent Tesla.  
   

2019: Office macros and AutoIT droppers {#h.au7mok1skeqt}
---------------------------------------

  
 Beginning in 2019, the campaigns associated with SWEED began leveraging
malicious Office macros. As with previous attacks, they are leveraging
spear-phishing emails and malicious attachments to initiate the
infection process.  

[]

The attached XLS contains an obfuscated VBA macro, which executes a
PowerShell script using a WMI call. The PowerShell script is also
obfuscated using XOR operations to hide its code. Once decoded, it
reveals itself to be .NET.  

[]

This .NET code is responsible for performing some checks and downloading
another executable file. The obfuscation scheme used in this code is the
same as the one used in the previously described PowerShell. The
downloaded file is then saved and executed.  

[]

Call graph after WMI execution.

  
 The downloaded binary is an AutoIT-compiled script. The script has a
lot of junk code designed to make the analysis more difficult and
time-consuming.  

[]

Extracted AutoIT script.

  
 The strings and some of the commands contained in the AutoIT script
have been obfuscated using XOR operations, as described below.  

[]

The decoder receives two hex strings: The first is the string to
deobfuscate, while the second determines the number of rounds of the XOR
operation. The XOR operation is performed on each character against the
length of the second parameter. This operation is then repeated for as
many times as the length with the length and the position. If the length
value is one, then the operation is repeated twice using the same key,
which leads to a plaintext hex string.  
   
 After performing environment checks, the malware will reconstruct the
assembly code which is obfuscated in a hex string. Using the AutoIT
scripting language Dll* family functions the code is loaded into the
current process address space.  

[]

Memory allocation

  
 Finally, the malware executes the assembly code with two arguments. The
first argument is the path for an executable. This assembly will create
a process with the executable and will inject the payload into this
process.  

[]

As expected, the final payload in this campaign is another packed
version of Agent Tesla.  

[]

UAC bypass {#h.jkandhtukhsk}
----------

  
 One of the common characteristics with several of the campaigns
associated with SWEED is the use of various techniques to bypass User
Account Control (UAC) on infected systems. An example of this is present
within the campaigns observed in 2019. When the malware is first
executed on systems, it executes "fodhelper.exe", which is a Windows
process running as high integrity. Prior to executing it, the malware
sets the following registry key:  
   

    HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command

  
 This registry key points to the location of the malicious executable:  

[]

This key is used by "fodhelper.exe" and its value is executed as
administrator whenever fodhelper.exe is executed. This functionality
simply allows for the malware to bypass UAC and is not a privilege
escalation vulnerability — the user must already have administrative
access rights on the system. It is used to avoid displaying a UAC prompt
to the user. This second instance of the malware is then executed with
administrative access to the infected system.   
   

SWEED infrastructure {#h.7cgaiqdijoc0}
--------------------

  
 The various distribution campaigns linked to SWEED feature use of a
limited amount of distribution and C2 infrastructure with the same
servers used across many different campaigns over long periods of time.
The majority of the registrants associated with the domains used by
SWEED list the following email addresses:  
   

    aaras480@gmail[.]com
    sweed.[redacted]@gmail[.]com

  
 The registrant contact information used to register most of the domains
is also consistent:  

[]

In April 2018, a security researcher published a screenshot of an RDP
server believed to have been actively leveraged by SWEED
(84.38.134[.]121):  

[]

In the screenshot above, the list of user accounts established on the
RDP server can be seen, which includes an account named "sweed." The
fact that multiple users are currently active indicates that this server
is being used in a multi-user capacity and provides a platform on which
members of SWEED can function collaboratively. This also likely
indicates a business relationship between multiple individuals
responsible for these ongoing malware distribution campaigns.  
   
 We also identified several DDNS domains which were being used to
facilitate connectivity to the shared RDP server that feature many of
the same values as the RDP user accounts:  

-   sweedoffice[.]duckdns[.]org
-   sweedoffice-olamide[.]duckdns[.]org
-   sweedoffice-chuks[.]duckdns[.]org
-   www.sweedoffice-kc.duckdns[.]org
-   sweedoffice-kc.duckdns[.]org
-   sweedoffice-goodman.duckdns[.]org
-   sweedoffice-bosskobi.duckdns[.]org
-   www.sweedoffice-olamide.duckdns[.]org
-   www.sweedoffice-chuks.duckdns[.]org

During our analysis of various campaigns associated with SWEED, we
identified several common elements that also reflect the distinct values
associated with users of the RDP server. In many cases, the distribution
servers being used to host malicious PE32 being distributed by SWEED
contained a directory structure consisting of multiple directories
containing the binaries being distributed. In many cases, the binary
file names used, as well as the directory names used to host the
malicious content reflected the same users present on the RDP server.   
   
 For example, in June 2019, the following URLs were hosting malicious
content associated with these campaigns:  

-   hxxp://aelna[.]com/file/chuks.exe
-   hxxp://aelna[.]com/file/sweed.exe
-   hxxp://aelna[.]com/file/duke.exe

Likewise, when investigating samples associated with known domains used
to exfiltrate sensitive information from infected systems, we can see
the following binary file names being used repeatedly across campaigns
over a long period of time:  

-   dadi.exe
-   kelly.exe
-   chuks.exe
-   olamide.exe
-   sweed.exe
-   kc.exe
-   hero.exe
-   goodman.exe
-   duke.exe
-   hipkid.exe

In several cases, the directory structure present on the distribution
servers contained multiple directories hosting malicious files, an
example listing below using the domain sodismodisfrance[.]cf:  

-   sodimodisfrance[.]cf/2/chuks.exe
-   sodimodisfrance[.]cf/6/chuks.exe
-   sodimodisfrance[.]cf/5/goodman.exe
-   sodimodisfrance[.]cf/1/chuks.exe
-   sodimodisfrance[.]cf/1/hipkid.exe
-   sodimodisfrance[.]cf/5/sweed.exe
-   sodimodisfrance[.]cf/2/duke.boys.exe

These appear to match the handles used by actors known to be associated
with SWEED. Another known domain used to exfiltrate sensitive
information collected by Agent Tesla is sweeddehacklord[.]us. Analysis
of known malware seen communicating with this domain shows similar
patterns of operations.  
   
 In analyzing the malware activity associated with SWEED, we also
investigated the use of interesting paths in the hosting of the
administration panels associated with the various RATs and stealers
being distributed by this group. Indeed, on a single C2 server, we
identified several panel with the following URLs:  

-   sweed-office.comie[.]ru/goodman/panel
-   sweed-office.comie[.]ru/kc/panel/
-   wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/omee/panel/login.php
-   wlttraco[.]com/sweed-client/humble1/panel/post.php
-   wlttraco[.]com/sweed-client/sima/panel/post.php
-   wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/omee/panel/post.php
-   wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/kc/panel/post.php
-   wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/olamide/panel/post.php
-   wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/jamil/panel/post.php
-   wlttraco[.]com/sweed-client/niggab/panel/post.php
-   wlttraco[.]com/sweed-client/humble2/panel/post.php
-   wlttraco[.]com/sweed-office/harry/panel/post.php

Based on our research, as well as the panel-hosting locations, we
believe that wiki, olamide, chuks, kc, goodman, bosskobi, dadi, hipkid,
and others are SWEED customers or business associates. Using the binary
file names, directory structures, and other artifacts, we have been able
to identify interesting online behavior and interests exhibited across
various hacking forums, IRC servers, etc. that appear to link some of
these users with various elements of the malware distribution
campaigns.  
   
 There are several other domains that can be linked to SWEED that appear
to be associated with various malware families and distribution
campaigns. These have been observed to resolve to the IP associated with
the aforementioned RDP server, as well.  

-   sweeddehacklord[.]us
-   sweed-office.comie[.]ru
-   sweed-viki[.]ru

Use of typosquatting

Another interesting element of many of the campaigns associated with
SWEED is the use of typosquatting for the domains used to host the
packed Agent Tesla binaries that have been distributed over the past few
years.  

[]

Victims' geographic dispersion.

  
 Looking at the victimology from a country point of view it is clear
that there is no geographic focus, when choosing their target. SWEED
target companies all over the world.  

[]

Breakdown of victim's activity by industry.

  
 The breakdown by activity however does show a clear tendency for
manufacturing and logistics companies.   
   
 Here's a rundown of these domains, along with the companies they are
supposed to look like and the industry that the company is associated
with. In some cases we were unable to determine the targeted
organization from the typosquatted domain.  

[]

In all of the domains listed above, the registrant account information
associated with the domains is consistent with what we have identified
as associated with SWEED campaign activity.  
   

Operational Security (OPSEC) {#h.iuhiuuydxxze}
----------------------------

  
 We identified various behavior on hacking forums, IRC channels, and
other web sites that appeared consistent with the TTPs we observed with
the actor distributing this malware.   
   

"SWEE D"

During our analysis, we identified a user on HackForums using the
moniker "SWEE D." In most of the online posts associated with this user,
their contact information was included in the post and listed the Skype
address "sweed.[redacted]".  
   
 In the months leading up to the January 2018 campaigns, we observed
this user posting asking for access to a Java crypter. Typically,
crypters are used to help evade antivirus detection as they "crypt" the
contents of the malicious payload being distributed.  

[]

The same user posted repeatedly in threads related to Java crypters, and
even annoyed other users with how often they were posting:  

[]

The same Skype account listed in the HackForums posts was also used by
someone using the name "Daniel" in 2016 while commenting on a blog
related to the creation of Facebook phishing pages:  

[]

This same Skype account was also used in 2015 by someone going by the
name "[redacted] Daniel."  

[]

Note: [redacted] is also the name used in the email address associated
with the registrant account for the domain wlttraco[.]com
(sweed.[redacted]@gmail.com).  
   
 We also located screenshots that were published on the Twitter account
.sS!.! showing the Discord server "Agent Tesla Live" that listed sweed
([redacted] Daniel) as a member of the staff.  

[]

It is important to note that the avatar used by this Discord user (SWEE
D) is the same avatar that is used by Skype user sweed.[redacted].  

[]

We actually contacted SWEE D on Skype and were able to confirm that the
same user operates the Discord and Skype accounts:  

[]

During our interaction with SWEE D, they mentioned that they are a
student studying ethical hacking and that they work in the IT
departments of various companies to help remove malware and increase
their security.  

[]

This is contrary to the following activity which was observed in an IRC
transaction where a user named "sweed" was submitting credit card
information to a bot listening in the channel in an effort to check the
validity and usability of presumably stolen credit card information.  

[]

The IRC channel appeared to be created and used solely for this purpose,
with a bot named "chkViadex24" returning information related to the
credit card that was submitted:  

[]

This is an example demonstrating how stolen credit information is
actively being used by adversaries to determine whether or not they can
monetize the information once they have stolen it from victims.  
   
 It's possible that "SWEE D", "sweed" and [redacted] Daniel may be the
same person. We also identified the following LinkedIn profile that
listed the same name:  

[]

This account lists Nigeria as their location. "[redacted]" is a Nigerian
novel. Many of the details we identified during our analysis of "sweed,"
such as information in the LinkedIn profile, the references to
"[redacted]," the registrant information used, and the location listed
in the Skype account indicate the individual is likely located in
Nigeria. We believe "sweed" is a key member of the group and that other
accounts are likely associated with customers or business partners.  
   

Conclusion {#h.ikxdkm7a5btw}
----------

  
 SWEED has been active for at least three years — and a user with that
name has been active on various forums, IRC channels and Discord servers
since at least 2015. Currently, SWEED is actively targeting small and
medium-sized companies around the world. Based on the TTPs used by this
group, SWEED should be considered a relatively amateur actor. They use
well-known vulnerabilities, commodity stealers and RATs (Pony, Formbook,
UnknownRAT, Agent Tesla, etc.) and appear to rely on kits readily
available on hacking forums. SWEED consistently leverages packing and
crypting in order to minimize detection by anti-malware solutions. We
assess that SWEED also does not have effective operational security, as
they used several of the same online accounts for about five years,
allowing for the discovery of a lot of their information, operations and
associates.  
   
 At this time, we cannot say with certainty whether the other accounts
and associated individuals associated with SWEED are business associates
or customers. However, they all use the same infrastructure in a
coordinated manner across domains, rely on the same malware and packers,
and all operate very similarly. While SWEED is relatively well-known in
the security research community, this research provides insight into how
these cybercriminal organizations operate and evolve over time in an
effort to maximize their ability to generate revenue and evade
detection. We expect SWEED to continue to operate for the foreseeable
future and we will continue to monitor their activities to ensure that
customers remain protected.
